   Blend Texture Panels


**Often used for**
   This is one of the most frequently used procedural textures. You can use blend textures to blend other textures together (with :guilabel:`Stencil`), or to create nice effects (especially with the :guilabel:`Mapping: Normal` trick). Just remember: if you use a ramp to create a custom blending, you may have to use :guilabel:`No RGB`, if the :guilabel:`Mapping` value needs an intensity input.
**Result(s)**
   Intensity. The Blend texture generates a smoothly interpolated progression.


Options
-------

:guilabel:`Progression`
   Profile of blend

   :guilabel:`Linear`
      A linear progression

:guilabel:`Quadratic`
   A quadratic progression
:guilabel:`Easing`
   A flowing, non-linear progression
:guilabel:`Diagonal`
   A diagonal progression
:guilabel:`Spherical`
   A progression with the shape of a three-dimensional ball
:guilabel:`Quadratic Sphere`
   A quadratic progression with the shape of a three-dimensional ball
:guilabel:`Radial`
   A radial progression
:guilabel:`Horizontal` / :guilabel:`Vertical`
   The direction of the progression is flipped a quarter turn.
