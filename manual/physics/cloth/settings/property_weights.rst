   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Physics --> Cloth --> Property Weights`

This panel is used to constrain certain cloth properties to a certain vertex group.
The properties that they control can be found in a combination of the *Physical Properties* and *Shape* panels.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.vertex_group_structural_stiffness:

Structural Group
   Defines a vertex group to control over structural stiffness.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.tension_stiffness_max:

Max Tension
   Maximum tension stiffness value.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.compression_stiffness_max:

Max Compression
   Maximum Compression stiffness value.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.vertex_group_shear_stiffness:

Shear Group
   Vertex group for fine control over shear stiffness.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.shear_stiffness_max:

Max Shearing
   Maximum shear scaling value.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.vertex_group_bending:

Bending Group
   Vertex group for fine control over bending stiffness.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.bending_stiffness_max:

Max Bending
   Maximum bending stiffness value.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.vertex_group_shrink:

Shrinking Group
   Vertex group for shrinking cloth.

.. _bpy.types.ClothSettings.shrink_max:

Max Shrinking
   Max amount to shrink cloth by, specifying a negative value controls the max amount for the cloth to grow.
