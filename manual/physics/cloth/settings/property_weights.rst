   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Physics --> Cloth --> Property Weights`

This panel is used to constrain certain cloth properties to a certain vertex group.
The properties that they control can be found in a combination of the *Physical Properties* and *Shape* panels.

Structural Group
   Defines a vertex group to control over structural stiffness.
Max Tension
   Maximum tension stiffness value.
Max Compression
   Maximum Compression stiffness value.

Shear Group
   Vertex group for fine control over shear stiffness.
Max Shearing
   Maximum shear scaling value.

Bending Group
   Vertex group for fine control over bending stiffness.
Max Bending
   Maximum bending stiffness value.

Shrinking Group
   Vertex group for shrinking cloth.
Max Shrinking
   Max amount to shrink cloth by, specifying a negative value controls the max amount for the cloth to grow.
