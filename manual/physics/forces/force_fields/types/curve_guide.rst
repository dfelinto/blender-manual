   :Type:      Curve Guide

The *Curve Guide* is used to force particles to follow a certain
path defined by a :doc:`Curve Object </modeling/curves/index>`.
A typical scenario would be to move a red blood cell inside a vein,
or to animate the particle flow in a motor.
You can also use *Curve Guide* to shape certain hair strands.

.. note::

   You can also use the :doc:`Particle Edit Mode </physics/particles/mode>` to define a path.

Since you can animate curves as a soft body or any other usual way,
you may build very complex animations while keeping great control and keeping the simulation time to a minimum.

The option *Curve Follow* does not work for particles. Instead you have to set *Angular Velocity*
(*Particle system* tab) to *Spin* and leave the rotation constant (i.e. do not turn on *Dynamic*).

A *Curve Guide* force affects all particles on the same layer, independently from their distance to the curve.
If you have several guides in a layer,
their fields add up to each other (the way you may have learned it in your physics course).
But you can limit their influence radius by changing the *Minimum Distance* (see below).

A particle follows a *Curve Guide* during its lifetime,
the velocity depends on its lifetime and the length of the path.

.. note::

   The Curve Guide does not affect :doc:`soft bodies </physics/soft_body/index>`.


Options
=======

.. TODO2.8:
   .. figure:: /images/physics_forces_force-fields_types_curve-guide_panel.png

      UI for a Curve Guide force field.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_free:

Free
   Fraction of particle life time, that is not used for the curve.

Falloff Power
   This setting governs the strength of the guide between *Min Distance* and *Max Distance*.
   A falloff of 1 means a linear progression.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.use_guide_path_add:

Additive
   If you use *Additive*, the speed of the particles is also evaluated depending on the falloff.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.use_guide_path_weight:

Weights
   Use Curve weights to influence the particle influence along the curve.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_clump_amount:

Clumping Amount
   The particles come together at the end of the curve (1) or they drift apart (-1).

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_clump_shape:

Shape
   Defines the form in which the particles come together.
   +0.99: the particles meet at the end of the curve.
   0: linear progression along the curve. -0.99: the particles meet at the beginning of the curve.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_minimum:

Min Distance
   The distance from the curve, up to where the force field is effective with full strength.
   If you have a falloff of 0, this parameter will have no effect,
   because the field is effective with full strength up to *Max Distance* (or the infinity).
   *Min Distance* is shown with a circle at the endpoints of the curve in the 3D Viewport.

Max Distance
   The maximum influence radius. Shown by an additional circle around the curve object.


Kink
----

.. warning::

   This feature is broken in the current version, see T46776.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_kink_type:

Type
   Changes the shape that the particles can take.

   :None: Todo.
   :Braid: Braid.
   :Curl: The radius of the influence depends on the distance of the curve to the emitter.
   :Radial: A three-dimensional, standing wave.
   :Roll: A one-dimensional, standing wave.
   :Rotation: Todo.
   :Wave: A two-dimensional, standing wave.

   It is not so easy to describe the resulting shapes, so have a look at the example below.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_kink_axis:

Axis
   Which axis to use for the offset.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_kink_frequency:

Frequency
   The frequency of the offset.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_kink_shape:

Shape
   Adjust the offset to the beginning/end.

.. _bpy.types.FieldSettings.guide_kink_amplitude:

Amplitude
   The Amplitude of the offset.
