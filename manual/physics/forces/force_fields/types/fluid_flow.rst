   :Type:      Fluid Flow

The *Fluid Flow* force field creates a force based on a :doc:`Fluid simulation </physics/fluid/index>` air flow.
It applies the smoke simulation air flow velocity as a force to other simulations that use force fields.
To use it you need to add a *Fluid Flow* force field and select a domain object for it.
For example fire sparkles can realistically flow along the air turbulence near the simulated fire.
