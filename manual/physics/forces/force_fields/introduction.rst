.. index:: Force Fields

************
Introduction
************

Force fields offer a way to influence a simulation, in example to add extra movement.
:doc:`Particles </physics/particles/index>`, :doc:`Soft Bodies </physics/soft_body/index>`,
:doc:`Rigid Bodies </physics/rigid_body/index>`, and :doc:`Cloth objects </physics/cloth/index>`
can all be affected by forces fields.
Force fields automatically affect everything.
To remove a simulation or particle system from their influence,
simply turn down the influence of that type of force field in its Field Weights panel.

- All types of objects and particles can generate fields,
  but only curve object can bear a :doc:`/physics/forces/force_fields/types/curve_guide` field.
- Force fields can also be generated from particles.
  See :doc:`Particle Physics </physics/particles/emitter/physics/index>`.
- The objects need to share at least one common layer to have an effect.

You may limit the effect on particles to a group of objects
(see the :doc:`Particle Physics </physics/particles/emitter/physics/index>` page).


Creating a Force Field
======================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Add --> Force Field`
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Physics --> Force Field`

To create a single force field,
you can select :menuselection:`Add --> Force Field` and select the desired force field.
This method creates an empty with the force field attached.

To create a field from an existing object you have to select the object and
change to the *Physics* tab. Select the field type in the *Fields* menu.

.. note::

   After changing the fields *Fields* panel or deflection *Collision* panel settings,
   you have to recalculate the particle, soft body or cloth system by *Free Cache*,
   this is not done automatically.

   Particles react to all kinds of force fields,
   soft bodies only to *Force*, *Wind*, *Vortex*
   (they react on *Harmonic* fields but not in a useful way).

Common Field Settings
=====================

Most fields have the same settings, even though they act very differently.
Settings unique to a field type are described below.
Curve Guide and Texture fields have very different options.

Shape
   Sets the direction which is used to calculate the effector force.
   For force fields from an empty object only *Point*, *Line* and *Plane* shapes are available,
   as for a field from a 3D object there are additional *Surface* and *Every Point* options,
   and *Curve* for a field from a curve.

   Point
      Point with omni-directional influence.
      Uses the object origin as the effector point.
   Line
      The force only acts in the local XY plane, using the Z axis line as the effector.
   Plane
      The force only acts in the local Z direction, using the XY axis plane as the effector.
   Surface
      The force field acts on a 3D object's surface.
      In this case, the Z axis is the surface normal.
   Every Point
      Uses every vertex in the mesh object as an effector point.
   Curve
      The force field acts along a curve object.

Strength
   The strength of the field effect.
   This can be positive or negative to change the direction that the force operates in.
   A force field's strength is scaled with the force object's scale,
   allowing you to scale up and down the scene, keeping the same effects.

Flow
   If non-zero, this adds a drag force proportional and opposite to the point velocity.

   This effectively re-interprets the force field so that the *Strength* to *Flow* ratio
   at a certain point defines the velocity of an "air flow" field, and objects are
   encouraged to follow the flow by the resistance caused by the *Flow* drag force.

Noise Amount
   Adds noise to the strength of the force.

Seed
   Changes the seed of the random noise.

Affect
   Location
      Influence the location of particles and other physics entities.
   Rotation
      Influence the rotation of particles with :doc:`Dynamic Rotation </physics/particles/emitter/rotation>`.
      The option is not relevant for other types of physics systems.

   Disabling both options completely deactivates the force field.

Absorption
   Force gets absorbed by collision objects.

Wind Factor
   Specifies how much the force is reduced when acting parallel to a surface, e.g. cloth.
   If set to 1, only the normal component of the force is taken into account.


Falloff
-------

Here you can specify the shape of the force field
(if the falloff *Power* is greater than 0).

Shape
   Sphere
      The falloff is uniform in all directions, as in a sphere.
   Tube
      The falloff results in a tube-shaped force field.
      The field's *Radial Power* can be adjusted,
      as well as the *Minimum* and *Maximum* distances of the field.
   Cone
      The falloff results in a cone-shaped force field. Additional options are the same as those of *Tube* options.

Z Direction
   The force can be set to apply only in the direction of the positive Z axis, negative Z axis, or both.

Power
   How the power of the force field changes with the distance from the force field.
   If *r* is the distance from the origin of the object, the force changes with 1/(*r* - *min* + 1)\ :sup:`power`.
   A falloff of 2 changes the force field with 1/(*r* - *min* + 1)\ :sup:`2`,
   which is similar to the falloff of gravitational pull.

Min Distance
   The distance from the object's origin, up to where the force field is effective with full strength.
   If you have a falloff of 0, this parameter will have no effect,
   because the field is effective with full strength up to *Max Distance* (or infinite).
   Shown by an additional circle around the object.

Max Distance
   Specifies the maximum radius in which the force field affects other objects
   (shown by an additional circle around the object).
