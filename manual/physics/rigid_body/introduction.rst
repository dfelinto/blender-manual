Introduction

The rigid body simulation can be used to simulate the motion of solid objects.
It affects the position and orientation of objects and does not deform them.

Unlike the other simulations in Blender, the rigid body simulation works closer with the animation system.
This means that rigid bodies can be used like regular objects and be part of parent-child relationships,
animation constraints and drivers.


Creating a Rigid Body
=====================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Properties --> Physics --> Rigid Body`
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object --> Rigid Body`

Only mesh objects can be part of a rigid body simulation.
To create rigid bodies, either click on the *Rigid Body* button in the *Physics* tab of
the Properties or use *Add Active*/*Add Passive* in the :menuselection:`Object --> Rigid Body` menu.

There are two types of rigid bodies: active and passive. *Active* bodies are dynamically simulated, while *passive*
bodies remain static. Both types can be driven by the animation system when using the *Animated* option.

During the simulation,
the rigid body system will override the position and orientation of dynamic rigid body objects.
Note however, that the location and rotation of the objects are not changed,
so the rigid body simulation acts similar to a constraint.
To apply the rigid body transformations you can use
the *Apply Object Transform* operator.

The scale of the rigid body object also influences the simulation, but is always controlled by the animation system.

Rigid body physics on the object can be *removed* with the *Rigid Body* button
in the *Physics* tab in the Properties or in the :menuselection:`Object --> Rigid Body` menu.


Working with Rigid Bodies
=========================

Several object operators exist for working with rigid bodies,
these operators can be found in the :doc:`/scene_layout/object/editing/rigid_body` object menu.
These operators include functions to add/remove rigid bodies, modify their properties,
and add :doc:`Rigid Body Constraints <manual/physics/rigid_body/constraints/index>`.
