   :Type:      Generic

The generic constraint has a lot of available parameters.

The X, Y, and Z axis constraints can be used to limit the amount of translation between the objects.
Clamping the min/max to zero has the same effect as the Point constraint.

Clamping the relative rotation to zero keeps the objects in alignment.
Combining an absolute rotation and translation clamp would behave much like the Fixed constraint.

Using a nonzero spread on any parameter allows it to oscillate
in that range throughout the course of the simulation.
