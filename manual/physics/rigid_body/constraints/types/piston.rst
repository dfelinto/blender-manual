   :Type:      Piston

A piston permits translation along the X axis of the constraint object.
It also allows rotation around the X axis of the constraint object.
It is like a combination of the freedoms of a slider with the freedoms of a hinge
(neither of which is very free alone).

   X Angle
      Enables/disables limit rotation around X axis.

      Lower
         Lower limit of X axis rotation.
      Upper
