Here are some simple examples showing the power of soft body physics.


A Bouncing Cube
===============

The Process
-----------

First, change your start and end frames to 1 and 150.

Then, add a plane, and scale it five times. Next, go to the physics tab, and add a collision.
The default settings are fine for this example.

Now add a cube, or use the default cube, then enter *Edit Mode* to subdivide it three times.
Add a Bevel Modifier to it to smoothen the edges and then to add a little more,
press :kbd:`R` twice, and move your cursor a bit.

When finished, your scene should look like this:

.. figure:: /images/physics_soft-body_examples_scene-ready.png
   :width: 520px

   The scene, ready for soft body physics.

Everything is ready to add the soft body physics.
Go to :menuselection:`Properties --> Physics` and choose *Soft Body*.
Uncheck the *Soft Body Goal*, and check *Soft Body Self Collision*.
Also, under *Soft Body Edges*, increase the Bending to 10.

Playing the animation will now give a slow animation of a bouncing cube.
To speed things up, we need to bake the soft body physics.

Under *Soft Body Cache* change the values of your start and end frames. In this case 1 and 150.
Now, to test if everything is working, you can take a cache step of 5 or 10,
but for the final animation it is better to reduce it to 1, to cache everything.

.. TODO2.8:
   When finished, your physics panel should look like this:

   .. figure:: /images/physics_soft-body_examples_physics-settings.png

      The physics settings.

You can now bake the simulation, give the cube materials and textures and render the animation.


The Result
