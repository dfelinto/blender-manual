Speed
   You can control the internal timing of the soft body system with this value.
   It sets the correlation between frame rate and tempo of the simulation.
   A free falling body should cover a distance of about ten meters after one second.
   You can adjust the scale of your scene and simulation with this correlation. If you
   render with 25 frames per second, you will have to set *Speed* to 1.3.
