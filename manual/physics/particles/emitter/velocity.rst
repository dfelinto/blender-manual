The initial velocity of particles can be set through different parameters,
based on the type of the particle system.
If the particle system type is Emitter or Hair,
then the following parameters give the particle an initial velocity.

Normal
   The emitter's surface normals (i.e. let the surface normal give the particle a starting speed).
Tangent
   Let the tangent speed give the particle a starting speed.
Tangent Phase
   Rotates the surface tangent.
Object Align
   Give an initial velocity in the X, Y, and Z axes.

   X, Y, Z
Object Velocity
   The emitter objects movement (i.e. let the object give the particle a starting speed).
Randomize
   Gives the starting speed a random variation.
   You can use a texture to only change the value, see Controlling Emission, Interaction and Time.
