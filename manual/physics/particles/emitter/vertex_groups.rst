   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Particle System --> Vertex Groups`

The Vertex groups panel allows you to specify vertex groups to use for several child particle settings.
You can also negate the effect of each vertex group with the checkboxes.
You can affect the following attributes:

Density
   Defines the density of the particle distribution.
Length
   Defines the length of the hair.
Clump
   Controls the amount of clumping.
   The weight of 1.0 gives current *Clump* value, weight of 0.0 completely removes effect.
Kink
   Controls the frequency of the children Kink.
Roughness 1
   Adjusts the *Uniform* roughness parameter.
Roughness 2
   Adjusts the *Random* roughness parameter.
Roughness End
   Adjusts the *Endpoint* roughness parameter.
Twist
   Vertex group to control the children's *Twist* effect.
   Gives control over the direction of the twist, as well as the amount.
   The weight of 0.5 is neutral, i.e. there is no twist effect.
