Common Problems
===============

Unsupported Graphics Driver Error
---------------------------------

This means your graphics card and driver do not have the minimum required OpenGL 3.3 version needed by Blender.

Installing the latest driver can help upgrade the OpenGL version,
though some graphics cards are simply too old to run the latest Blender.
Using Blender 2.79 or earlier is the only option then.


Crash on Startup
----------------

Try running Blender from the :doc:`command line </advanced/command_line/index>`,
to see if any helpful error messages are printed.

On Windows, graphics drivers can sometimes get corrupted.
In this case it can help to uninstall all graphics drivers (there may be multiple from Intel, AMD and Nvidia) and
perform a clean installation with drivers from the manufacturer's website.


Poor Performance
----------------

- Update your graphics drivers (see above).
- On laptops, make sure you are using a dedicated GPU (see above).
- Try lowering quality settings in :menuselection:`Preferences --> System --> Memory & Limits`.
- Try undoing settings in your graphics drivers, if you made any changes there.


Render Errors
-------------

See :doc:`Eevee </render/eevee/limitations>` and
:doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/gpu_rendering>` documentation respectively.


Wrong Selection in 3D Viewport
------------------------------

See :ref:`Invalid Selection, Disable Anti-Aliasing <troubleshooting-3dview-invalid-selection>`.


Virtual Machines
----------------

Running Blender inside a virtual machine is known to have problems
when OpenGL drawing calls are forwarded to the host operating system.

To resolve this, configure the system to use PCI passthrough.


Information
===========

To find out which graphics card and driver Blender is using,
use :menuselection:`Help --> Save System Info` inside Blender.
The OpenGL section will have information about your graphics card, vendor and driver version.
