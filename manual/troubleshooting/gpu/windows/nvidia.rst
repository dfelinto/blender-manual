On Windows drivers are provided by the graphics card manufacturer (Nvidia).
Windows update automatically installs graphics drivers, or
your computer manufacturer may provide its own version of the graphics drivers.

However these are not always the latest version or may have been corrupted in some way.
We recommend to always use the official drivers.
