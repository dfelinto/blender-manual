Recovering Data
***************

Computer crashes, power outages, or simply forgetting to save can result in
the loss or corruption of your work. You can use Blender's *Auto Save* feature
to reduce the chance of losing files when such events occur.

There are options to save a backup of your files like
*Auto Save* that saves your file automatically over time, and *Save on Quit*,
which saves your blend-file automatically when you exit Blender.
In addition to these functions being enabled by default,
the *Save on Quit* functionality cannot be disabled.

.. note::

   For your actions, there are options like *Undo*, *Redo* and an *Undo History*,
   used to roll back from mistakes under normal operation, or return back to a specific action.
   See :doc:`/interface/undo_redo`.

The *File* tab of the *Preferences* allows you to configure the two ways
that Blender provides for you to regress to a previous version of your work.
See :ref:`Auto Save Preferences <prefs-auto-save>` for details.

Recovering Auto Saves
=====================

Last Session
------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`File --> Recover --> Last Session`

The *Recover Last Session* will open the ``quit.blend`` file
that is saved into the :ref:`temp-dir` when you quit Blender under normal operation.
Note that files in your temporary directory may be deleted when you reboot your computer
(depending on your system configuration).


Auto Save
---------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`File --> Recover --> Auto Save`

The *Recover Auto Save* allows you to open the *Auto Saved* file.
You will have to navigate to your :ref:`temp-dir`.
The *Auto Saved* files are named using a random number and have a blend extension.

Trusted Source
   When enabled, Python scripts and drivers that may be included in the file will be run automatically.
   Enable this only if you created the file yourself,
   or you trust that the person who gave it to you did not include any malicious code with it.
   See :doc:`Python Security </advanced/scripting/security>` to configure default trust options.

.. tip::

   It is important, when browsing, to enable the detailed list view.
   Otherwise, you will not be able to figure out the dates of the auto-saved blend-files.

.. warning::

   When recovering an *Auto Saved* file, you will lose any changes made since the last *Auto Save* was performed.
   Only one *Auto Saved* file exists for each project, i.e. Blender does not keep older versions.
   Hence, you will not be able to go back more than a few minutes with this tool.
