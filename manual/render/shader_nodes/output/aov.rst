   AOV Output Node.

Shader AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) provide custom render passes for arbitrary shader node components.
As an artist this can be a good way to debug or tweak very fine details of a scene in post-processing.
To use shader AOVs create the pass in the :ref:`Shader AOV <bpy.types.AOV>` panel
then reference that pass with the *AOV Output* shading node.
Shader AOVs can be added or removed in the *Shader AOV* panel.

.. tip::

   The *AOV Output* node can be used in Material and World shader nodes.
