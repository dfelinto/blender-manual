   Particle Info Node.

The *Particle Info* node can be used in the material node tree for objects that are used as the instancing objects,
when you use *Object* or *Group* :doc:`Render mode </physics/particles/emitter/render>` of a particle system.

This node gives access to the data of the particle that spawned the object instance.
It can be useful to give some variation to a single material assigned to multiple instances of instancing object.

.. note::

   This node currently only supports parent particles. Info from child particles is not available.

Index
   Index number of the particle (from 0 to number of particles).
Random

   It can for example be used in combination with a color ramp, to randomize the particle color.
Age
   Age of the particle in frames.
Lifetime
   Total lifespan of the particle in frames.
Location
