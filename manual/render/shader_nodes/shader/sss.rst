   Subsurface Scattering Shader.

The *Subsurface Scattering* node is used to add simple subsurface multiple scattering,
for materials such as skin, wax, marble, milk and others. For these materials,
rather than light being reflect directly off the surface, it will penetrate the surface and
bounce around internally before getting absorbed or leaving the surface at a nearby point.

How far the color scatters on average can be configured per RGB color channel. For example,
for skin, red colors scatter further, which gives distinctive red-colored shadows,
and a soft appearance.


Inputs
======

Color
   Color of the surface, or physically speaking, the probability that light is reflected for each wavelength.
Scale
   Global scale factor for the scattering radius.
Radius
   Average distance that light scatters below the surface.
   Higher radius gives a softer appearance, as light bleeds into shadows and through the object.
   The scattering distance is specified separately for the RGB channels,
   to render materials such as skin where red light scatters deeper.
   The X, Y and Z values are mapped to the R, G and B values, respectively.
IOR :guilabel:`Cycles Only`
   Index of refraction for *Subsurface Scattering*.
Anisotropy :guilabel:`Cycles Only`
   Controls the directionality of subsurface scattering.
Normal
   Normal used for shading; if nothing is connected the default shading normal is used.


Properties
==========

Subsurface Method
   Rendering method to simulate subsurface scattering.

   .. note:: Eevee does use not support the *Random Walk* methods.

   :Christensen-Burley:
      An approximation to physically-based volume scattering.
      This method is less accurate than *Random Walk* however,
      in some situations this method will resolve noise faster.
   :Random Walk (Fixed Radius):
      Provides accurate results for thin and curved objects.
      Random Walk uses true volumetric scattering inside the mesh,
      which means that it works best for closed meshes.
      Overlapping faces and holes in the mesh can cause problems.
   :Random Walk:
      Behaves similarly to *Random Walk (Fixed Radius)* but modulates
      the *Radius* based on the *Color*, *Anisotropy*, and *IOR*.
      This method thereby attempts to retain greater surface detail and color
      than *Random Walk (Fixed Radius)*.


Outputs
=======

BSSRDF
   :abbr:`BSSRDF (Bidirectional Scattering Surface Reflectance Distribution Function)` shader output.
