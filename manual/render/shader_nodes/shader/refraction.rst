   Refraction BSDF.

The *Refraction* :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function)`
is used to add glossy refraction with sharp or microfacet distribution,
used for materials that transmit light. For best results this node should be considered as
a building block and not be used on its own,
but rather mixed with a glossy node using a Fresnel factor.
Otherwise it will give quite dark results at the edges for glossy refraction.


Inputs
======

Color
   Color of the surface, or physically speaking, the probability that light is refracted for each wavelength.
Roughness
   Influences sharpness of the refraction; perfectly sharp at 0.0 and smoother with higher values.
Normal
   Normal used for shading; if nothing is connected the default shading normal is used.


Properties
==========

Distribution
   Microfacet distribution to use. *Sharp* results in perfectly sharp refractions,
   while *Beckmann* and *GGX* can use the *Roughness* input for blurry refractions.


Outputs
=======

BSDF
   Standard shader output.
