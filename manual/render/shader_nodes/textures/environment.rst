The Node *Environmental Texture* is used to light your scene using an environment map image file as a texture.


Inputs
======

Vector
   Texture coordinate for texture look-up. If this socket is left unconnected,
   the image is mapped as environment with the Z axis as up.


Properties
==========

Image
   Image data-block used as the image source.
   Additional settings can be found in :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Item --> Properties`:
   These include options to control the alpha channel along with addition options for the color space.
   These addition options are documented with the rest of
   :ref:`Common Image Settings <editors-image-image-settings-common>`.
Color Space
   Type of data that the image contains, either Color or Non-Color Data.
   For most color textures the default of Color should be used, but in case of e.g. a bump or alpha map,
   the pixel values should be interpreted as Non-Color Data, to avoid doing any unwanted color space conversions.
Texture Interpolation
   Interpolation method used for the environment texture. The following interpolations are available:

   .. same as in the Image Texture node

   :Linear: Regular quality interpolation.
   :Closest: No interpolation, use closest pixel.
   :Cubic: Smoother, better quality interpolation.
   :Smart: Bicubic when magnifying, otherwise Bilinear is used.
      This is only available for :doc:`OSL </render/shader_nodes/osl>`.

Projection Method
   Allows you to use different types of environmental maps. The following methods are supported:

   :Equirectangular: Projection from an Equirectangular photo.
   :Mirror Ball: Projection from an orthographic photo or mirror ball.


Outputs
=======

Color
   RGB color from the image.
