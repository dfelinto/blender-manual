Multi-view is a complete toolset for working with stereoscopic rendering in Blender.
It works with both the Eevee and Cycles rendering engines.
Cycles additionally supports stereoscopic panoramic cameras.
There is support for many different stereo 3D visualization types.

.. note::

   If you have a real 3D display at some point you can change the 3D display mode in the Window menu,
   by calling the Stereo 3D operator.
   Be aware that some modes require a fullscreen editor to work, and this can be taxing on your CPU.
