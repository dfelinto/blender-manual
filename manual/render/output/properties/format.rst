   Format panel.

Several render presets exist with common resolution and frame rates
for TVs and screens can be selected in the panel header.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.resolution_x:
.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.resolution_y:

Resolution X, Y
   The number of pixels horizontally and vertically in the image.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.resolution_percentage:

Percentage
   Slider to reduce or increase the size of the rendered image relative to the *Resolution* values.
   This is useful for small test renders that have the same proportions as the final image.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.pixel_aspect_x:
.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.pixel_aspect_y:

Aspect X, Y
   Older televisions may have non-square pixels,
   so this can be used to control the shape of the pixels along the respective axis.
   This will *pre-distort* the images which will look stretched on a computer screen,
   but which will display correctly on a TV set.
   It is important that you use the correct pixel aspect ratio when rendering to prevent re-scaling,
   resulting in lowered image quality.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.use_border:

Render Region
   Renders just a portion of the view instead of the entire frame.
   See the :ref:`Render Region <editors-3dview-navigate-render-region>`
   documentation to see how to define the size of the render region.

   .. note::

      This disables the *Save Buffers* option in the Performance panel.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.use_crop_to_border:

Crop to Render Region
   Crops the rendered image to the size of the render region,
   instead of rendering a transparent background around it.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.fps:
.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.fps_base:

Frame Rate
   The number of frames that are displayed per second, relevant for :doc:`Animation </render/output/animation>`.
   The menu gives several common frame rates, custom frame rates can be used by selecting *Custom*
   which gives access to the following properties:

   FPS
      The frame rate, expressed in frames per second.
   Base
      Some standards require a more precise frame rate, for example NTSC.
      These can be represent as a fraction where the *Base* value
      is used as the fraction's denominator and the FPS being the numerator:
      :math:`\frac{FPS}{Base}`.
