Shape
   :Strand:
      Render curves as a thin strand roughly a pixel wide.
      Curve diameter parameters are ignored with this setting.

   :Strip:
      Render curves as a flat ribbon with rounded normals.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.hair_subdiv:

Additional Subdivisions
   Additional subdivisions to be applied on top of the curve resolution set in the
   hair system settings. Increasing this value will smooth out the curves of the strands.
