Probe objects are used by Eevee as support objects.
They record lighting information locally in order to light the scene using indirect lighting.

There are three different probe types. One for diffuse lighting, two for specular lighting.

These types of objects are only useful for Eevee (and by extension, the Material Preview mode).
They are meant to guide the engine to compute better lighting quickly.
