Cycles is Blender's physically-based path tracer for production rendering.
It is designed to provide physically based results out-of-the-box,
with artistic control and flexible shading nodes for production needs.

To use Cycles, select it as the *Render Engine* in the Render properties.
For :doc:`GPU accelerated rendering </render/cycles/gpu_rendering>`,
enable compatible devices in :menuselection:`Preferences --> System --> Cycles Render Devices`.
