.. _cycles-experimental-features:

Experimental features are disabled / hidden by default,
but can be enabled by setting *Feature Set* to *Experimental* in the Render properties.
Enabling the *Experimental Feature Set* will use experimental
and incomplete features that might be broken or change in the future.

Adaptive subdivision is currently the only experimental feature.
