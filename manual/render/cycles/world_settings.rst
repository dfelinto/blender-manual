Mist Pass
=========

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`World --> Mist Pass`

.. note::

   The mist pass must be enabled in the View Layer tab
   of the :doc:`Properties Editor </editors/properties_editor>`
   before the settings below are available in the World tab.

Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To create mist,
Blender generates a render layer with a depth map ranging between 0.0 and 1.0
that can be used in the Compositor to generate a mist effect.

.. _bpy.types.WorldMistSettings.start:

Start
   The distance from the camera at which the mist starts to fade in.

.. _bpy.types.WorldMistSettings.depth:

Depth
   The distance from *Start* of the mist, that it fades in over.
   Objects further from the camera than *Start + Depth* are completely hidden by the mist.

.. _bpy.types.WorldMistSettings.falloff:

Falloff
   The curve function that controls the rate of change of the mist's strength further and further into the distance.

   :Quadratic:
      Uses the same calculation as light falloff (:math:`1\over{x^2}`) and provides the smoothest
      transition from transparent (0.0) to opaque (1.0).
   :Linear: Has a steeper start than quadratic (:math:`1\over{x}`).
   :Inverse Quadratic:
      Has the steepest start (:math:`1\over{\sqrt{x}}`) and approaches 1.0 faster than the other two functions.

.. tip::

   A visualization can be activated in the :menuselection:`Camera --> Viewport Display` panel.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesVisibilitySettings.camera:

Ray Visibility
==============

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`World --> Ray Visibility`

As with other objects,
*Ray Visibility* allows you to control which other shaders can "see" the environment.


Tricks
------

Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is directly visible versus one
that is indirectly lighting the objects. A simple solution to this is to add a Mix node,
with the *Blend Factor* set to *Is Camera Ray*. The first input color is then the indirect color,
and the second the directly visible color. This is useful when using a high-res image for
the background and a low-res image for the actual lighting.

Similarly, adding the *Is Camera* and *Is Glossy* rays will mean that the high-res image
will also be visible in reflections.

   Nodes for the trick above.

Surface
-------

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.sampling_method:

Sampling
   Controls the sampling method for the world material. Selecting Auto or Manual enables
   *Multiple Importance Sampling* while None disables it. *Multiple Importance Sampling*
   is a method to sample the background texture such that lighter parts are favored,
   creating an importance map. It will produce less noise in the render in trade of artifacts (:term:`Fireflies`).
   Enable this when using an image texture with small area lights (like the sun),
   otherwise noise can take a long time to converge.

   Below is a comparison between *Multiple Importance Sample* off and on.
   Both images are rendered for 25 seconds (Off: 1,500 samples, On: 1,000 samples).

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: /images/render_cycles_world-settings_mis-off.jpg

             Multiple Importance Sample off.

        - .. figure:: /images/render_cycles_world-settings_mis-on.jpg

             Multiple Importance Sample on.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.sample_map_resolution:

Map Resolution
   Sets the resolution of the importance map.
   A higher resolution will better detect small features in the map and give more accurate sampling
   but conversely will take up more memory and render slightly slower.
   Higher values also may produce less noise when using high-res images.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.max_bounces:

Max Bounces
   Maximal number of bounces the background light will contribute to the render.

.. seealso::

   See :doc:`Reducing Noise </render/cycles/optimizations/reducing_noise>`
   for more information on how to reduce noise.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.is_caustics_light:

Shadow Caustics
   Mark the World Shader as a refractive caustic caster. This setting can be used in conjunction with the
   :ref:`Cast and Receive caustics object settings <bpy.types.CyclesObjectSettings.is_caustics_caster>`
   to selectively speed up refractive caustic rendering of select objects.



Volume
------

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.volume_sampling:

Sampling Method
   :Distance:
      For dense volumes lit from far away *Distance* sampling is more efficient in most cases.
      Usually this shouldn't be used for World volumes.
   :Equiangular:
      If you have got a light inside or near the volume then *equiangular* sampling is better.
   :Multiple Importance:
      If you have a combination of both, then the multiple importance sampling will be better.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.volume_interpolation:

Interpolation
   Interpolation method to use for the volume.

   :Linear: Simple interpolation which gives good results for thin volumes.
   :Cubic: Smoothed high-quality interpolation needed for more dense volumes, but slower.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.homogeneous_volume:

Homogeneous
   Assume volume has the same density everywhere (not using any textures), for faster rendering.
   Usually this is automatically determined by the renderer.
   This settings provides a manual control for cases where it is not detected.

.. _bpy.types.CyclesWorldSettings.volume_step_size:

Step Size
   Distance between volume shader samples for world volume shaders.
   See :doc:`Volume Render Settings </render/cycles/render_settings/volumes>` for more information.


Light Group
-----------

.. _bpy.types.World.lightgroup:

Light Group :guilabel:`Cycles only`
   Select the :ref:`Light Group <bpy.types.ViewLayer.active_lightgroup_index>` to add the
   current *World Surface Shader* too.

   Add Light Group
      If the name input into the *Light Group* field does not align with an existing
      Light Group, then pressing this button will create a *Light Group* with that name
      and assign this *World Shader* to it.
