   Freestyle core options.


Activating Freestyle in the :guilabel:`Render` context of the :guilabel:`Buttons` window will
give you the following options:

Line Thickness
   There are two different modes for defining the base line thickness:

   Absolute
      The line thickness is given by a user-specified number of pixels. The default value is **1.0**.
   Relative
      The unit line thickness is scaled by the proportion of the present vertical image resolution to **480** pixels.
      For instance, the unit line thickness is **1.0** with the image height set to **480**, **1.5** with **720**,
      and **2.0** with **960**.

Line Thickness
   Only for :guilabel:`Absolute` line thickness: base line thickness in pixels, **1.0** by default.
