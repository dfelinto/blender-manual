   Line Style: Thickness.

Base Thickness
   The base thickness for this line style.

Thickness Position
   Control the position of stroke thickness from the original (backbone) stroke geometry. There are four choices:

   :Center:
      The thickness is evenly split to the left and right side of the stroke geometry.
   :Inside:
      The strokes are drawn within object boundary.
   :Outside:
      The strokes are drawn outside the object boundary.
   :Relative:
      Specifies the relative position by a number between 0.0 (inside) and 1.0 (outside),
      in the *Thickness Ratio* number field just below.

   .. note::

      The thickness position options are applied only to strokes of edge types
      *Silhouette* and *Border*,
      since these are the only edge types defined in terms of the object boundary.
      Strokes of other edge types are always drawn using the *Center* option.
