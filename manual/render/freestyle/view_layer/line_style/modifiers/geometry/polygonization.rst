**************
Polygonization
**************

The *Polygonization* modifier simplifies strokes as much as possible
(in other words, it transforms smooth strokes into jagged polylines).

Error
   The maximum distance allowed between the new simplified stroke and the original one
   (the larger this value is, the more jagged/approximated the resulting polylines are).
