********************
Distance from Camera
********************

The *Distance from Camera* modifier alters the base property with a new one
from a given range using the distance to the active *camera*.

Range Min, Max
   The limits of the mapping from "distance to camera" to "property in mapping".
   If the current point of the stroke is at *Range Min* or less from the active camera or the object,
   it will take the start value. And conversely,
   if it is at *Range Max* or more from the camera/object, it will take the end value.
   These values are in the current scene's units, not in pixels!

Fill Range by Selection
   Set the min/max range values from the distances between the current selected mesh vertices and
   the camera or the target.
