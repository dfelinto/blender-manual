Freestyle
*********

`Freestyle <http://freestyle.sourceforge.net>`__ is a render engine for creating Non-Photorealistic Line Drawing images from 3D scenes. It is designed as a programmable interface to allow maximum control over the style of the final drawing: the user "programs" how the silhouettes and other feature lines from the 3D model should be turned into stylized strokes using a set of programmable operators dedicated to style description.
