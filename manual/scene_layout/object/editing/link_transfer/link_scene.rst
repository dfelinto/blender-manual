Links the selected objects into a different scene than the current one.
The *Link Objects to Scene* in the :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel lets you choose between scenes.

This makes the same object exist in more than one scene at once,
including its position and animation data.
The object's origin will change its color to reflect that.
