Collections
***********

There can be many objects in a scene: A typical stage scene consists of furniture, props,
lights, and backdrops.
Blender helps you keep everything organized by allowing you to group like objects together.
Objects can be grouped together without any kind of transformation relationship (unlike parenting).
Collections are used to just logically organize your scene,
or to facilitate one-step appending or linking between files or across scenes.
