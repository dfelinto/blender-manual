Collections
***********

There can be many objects in a scene: A typical stage scene consists of furniture, props,
lights, and backdrops.
Blender helps you keep everything organized by allowing you to group like objects together.
Objects can be grouped together without any kind of transformation relationship (unlike parenting).
Collections are used to just logically organize your scene,
or to facilitate one-step appending or linking between files or across scenes.


.. _scene-layout_collections_collections_tab:

Collections Tab
===============

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Properties --> Collection Properties`

Collection properties tab allows convenient access to properties for the active collection.

.. figure:: /images/scene-layout_collections_property_panel.png

   Collection properties.

Restrictions
------------

Selectable
   Toggles the ability to select the objects from the 3D Viewport.
   This is useful for if you have placed something in the scene and
   do not want to accidentally select it when working on something else.

Disable in Renders
   Enables/disables visibility of the collection in renders.

Holdout
   Objects inside this collection will generate a holdout/mask in the active view layer.

Indirect Only
   Objects inside this collection will only contribute to the final image
   indirectly through shadows and reflections.


Instancing
----------

Instance Offset X, Y Z
   Applies a spatial offset of the instanced collections from the original object's origin.


.. _scene_layout-collections-line-art:

Line Art
--------

.. _bpy.types.Collection.lineart_usage:

Usage
   How the collection is loaded into line art.
   Child objects of the collection can override this setting
   if they wish in :ref:`Object Properties <bpy.types.ObjectLineArt.usage>`.

   :Include: Generate feature lines for this collection.
   :Occlusion Only:
      Objects in the collection will only cause occlusion to existing feature lines
      and their geometry stay invisible.
   :Exclude:
      Objects in this collection will not be loaded into line art at all.
   :Intersection Only:
      Objects in the collection will only produce intersection lines in
      the scene and their own geometry stay invisible.
   :No Intersection: Include this collection but do not generate intersection lines.

.. _bpy.types.Collection.lineart_use_intersection_mask:

Collection Mask
   Use custom intersection mask for faces in this collection.
   Intersection masks can be used by the Line Art modifier to filter lines.
   See :ref:`Collection Masks <bpy.types.LineartGpencilModifier.use_intersection_mask>` for more information.

.. _bpy.types.Collection.lineart_intersection_mask:

Mask
   Intersections generated by this collection will have this mask value.

.. _bpy.types.Collection.use_lineart_intersection_priority:
.. _bpy.types.Collection.lineart_intersection_priority:

Intersection Priority
   Assigns an intersection priority value for this collection.
   The intersection line will be included into the object with the higher intersection priority value.


Custom Properties
-----------------

Create and manage your own properties to store data in the collection's data block.
See the :ref:`Custom Properties <files-data_blocks-custom-properties>` page for more information.


Collections Menu
================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object --> Collection`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`M`, :kbd:`Shift-M`, :kbd:`Ctrl-G`, etc.

Move to Collection :kbd:`M`
   Move selected objects to an existing or new collection.
Link to Collection :kbd:`Shift-M`
   Add selected objects to a collection, while keeping them in their current collection.
   This way objects can appear in multiple collections.
   A new collection can be created in the pop-up.
Create New Collection :kbd:`Ctrl-G`
   Creates a new collection and adds the selected object(s) to it.
   The name of the new collection can be specified in
   the *Create New Collection* :ref:`bpy.ops.screen.redo_last` panel.
   This collection is not linked to the active scene.
Remove from Collection :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-G`
   Remove the selected objects from a collection. If the object belongs to more than one collection,
   a pop-up lets you select the collection and an option to remove it from all collections.
Remove from All Collections :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-G`
   Remove the selected objects from all collections.
Add Selected to Active Collection :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-G`
   Adds the selected objects to the collections to which the active object belongs.
Remove Selected from Active Collection :kbd:`Shift-Alt-G`
   Causes the selected objects to be removed from the collections to which the active object belongs.


.. _scene-layout_collections_collections_panel:

Collections Panel
=================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Object tab --> Collections`

.. figure:: /images/scene-layout_collections_collections_panel.png

   Collections panel.

All collections that an object has been assigned to are listed in the Properties
:menuselection:`Object tab --> Collections panel`.

Add to Collection
   Adds the selected object to a collection.
   A pop-up lets you specify the collection to add to.
New ``+``
   Creates a new collection and adds the selected object to it.
Name
   To rename a collection, simply click in the collections name field.
Remove ``X``
   To remove an object from a collection,
   find the name of the collection from which you wish to remove the object,
   and click the ``X`` button to the right of the collection name.
Specials
   Unlink Collection, Select Collection, Set Offset from Cursor
Offset
   Applies a spatial offset of the instanced collections from the original object's origin.

.. seealso:: Appending or Linking Collections

   To append a collection from another blend-file,
   consult :doc:`this page </files/linked_libraries/index>`.
   In summary, :menuselection:`File --> Link/Append Link` Select a blend-file and then the collection.

.. tip:: Selecting Collections

   Collections can be selected, see :ref:`Select Grouped <bpy.ops.object.select_grouped>` for more information.
