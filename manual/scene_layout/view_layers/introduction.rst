The visibility controls are part of *view layers*, designed to help organizing
what you want to see or work on.

   View layers and collections.

View layers reference to :doc:`collections </scene_layout/collections/introduction>`,
and allow to set their visibility, selectability and other options.
A *view layer* can have any collection enabled, and multiple *view layers*
can use the same or different collections.

.. seealso::

   Each view layer can be rendered separately as individual :doc:`Render Layers </render/layers/introduction>`
   to help composite your scene.

You can edit the *view layer* collections in the :ref:`Outliner <editors-outliner-editing-collections>`.
