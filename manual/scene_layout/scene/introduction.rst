Scenes are a way to organize your work.
Each blend-file can contain multiple scenes, which share other data such as objects and materials.

Scene management and library appending/linking are based on Blender's
:doc:`Library and Data System </files/index>`,
so it is a good idea to read that manual page first,
if you are not familiar with the basics of that system.

You can select and create scenes with the *Scene* data-block menu
in the :doc:`Topbar </interface/window_system/topbar>`.

Scenes
   A list of available scenes.
Add
   New
      Creates an empty scene with default values.
   Copy Settings
      Creates an empty scene, but also copies
      the settings from the active scene into the new one.
   Linked Copy
      This option creates a new scene with the same settings and contents as the active scene.
      However, instead of copying the objects,
      the new scene contains links to the collections in the old scene.
      Therefore, changes to objects in the new scene will result in the same
      changes to the original scene, because the objects used are literally the same.
      The reverse is also true.
   Full Copy
      Using this option, nothing is shared.
      This option creates a fully independent scene with copies of the active scene's contents.
      Every object in the original scene is duplicated, and a duplicate,
      private copy of its object-data is made as well.

   .. note::

      To choose between these options,
      it is useful to understand the difference between *Object* and *Object Data*.
      The choices for adding a scene, therefore, determine just how much of this information will be
      *copied from* the active scene to the new one, and how much will be *shared* (linked).

Delete ``X``
   You can delete the current scene by clicking the *X*
   next to the name in the :doc:`Topbar </interface/window_system/topbar>`.

.. seealso:: Linking to a Scene

   You can :ref:`link <bpy.ops.object.make_links_scene>` any object from one scene to another.
