Introduction
************

A *Keyframe* is simply a marker of time which stores the value of a property.

For example, a Keyframe might define that the horizontal position of a cube is at 3 m on frame 1.

The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, meaning, for example,
that the user could then add another key on frame 10, specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20 m,
and Blender will automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the frames between frame 1 and 10
depending on the chosen interpolation method (e.g. Linear, Bézier, Quadratic, etc.).

An overview of existing keyframes can be seen via the :doc:`Dope Sheet </editors/dope_sheet/index>` editor.


Visualization
=============

There are some important visualization features in the 3D Views that can help animation.

When the current frame is a keyframe for the current active object, the name of this object
(shown in the upper left corner of the 3D Views) turns yellow.

Interpolation
=============

Keyframe interpolation is represented and controlled by
:doc:`animation curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>`,
also known as :term:`F-Curves <F-Curve>`. These curves can be viewed and modified
via the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/index>`.

.. figure:: /images/animation_keyframes_introduction_curves.png
   :align: center

   Constant, Linear, Quadratic and Bézier interpolation, with Linear extrapolation.

The X axis of the curve corresponds to time, while Y represents the value of the property.
Keyframes themselves define points of the curve, while interpolation is controlled by additional parameters.

The :ref:`Interpolation Mode <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation>` is the main setting
that specifies for each keyframe how the curve is interpolated from that key to
the next one. There are a number of modes with fixed shapes,
e.g. *Constant*, *Linear*, *Quadratic* etc, and a free form *Bézier* mode.

:ref:`Extrapolation <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-extrapolation>` specifies how
the curve extends before the first, and after the last keyframe.
The main available choices are *Constant* and *Linear*;
it is also possible to configure the curve to loop.

*Bézier* interpolation is controlled by handles, which have
a :ref:`handle type <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>` and position.
The position of *Free* and *Aligned* handles must be set manually from the Graph editor,
while *Vector*, *Automatic* and *Auto Clamped* handles are computed automatically from
keyframe values.

Interpolation, Extrapolation and Handle Type can also be changed from
the :doc:`Dope Sheet </editors/dope_sheet/index>` editor.

   Handle smoothing modes. Yellow: *None*, Cyan: *Continuous Acceleration*.

The method how the three automatic handle types are computed is controlled by
the per-curve :ref:`Auto Handle Smoothing <graph_editor-auto-handle-smoothing>` setting.
The *None* mode resembles how most other software works and only considers the values
of the immediately adjacent keys. The *Continuous Acceleration* mode considers the shape
of the whole curve, which produces smoother results out of the box, but means that changes
in one key affect interpolation over a larger section of the curve; it also tends to
overshoot more with *Automatic* handles.


.. _keyframe-type:

Keyframe Types
==============

For visually distinguishing regular keyframes from different animation events or
states (extremes, breakdowns, or other in-betweens)
there is the possibility of applying different colors on them for visualization.

   Left: not selected; Right: selected.

Keyframe (white / yellow diamond)
   Normal keyframe.
Breakdown (small cyan diamond)
   Breakdown state. e.g. for transitions between key poses.
Moving Hold (dark gray / orange diamond)
   A keyframe that adds a small amount of motion around a holding pose.
   In the Dope Sheet it will also display a bar between them.
Extreme (big pink diamond)
   An 'extreme' state, or some other purpose as needed.
Jitter (tiny green diamond)
   A filler or baked keyframe for keying on ones, or some other purpose as needed.


.. _keyframe-handle-display:

Handles & Interpolation Mode Display
====================================

Dope Sheet can display the Bézier handle type associated with the keyframe,
and mark segments with non-Bézier interpolation.
This facilitates basic editing of interpolation without the use of the Graph Editor.

The icon shape represents the type of the :ref:`Bézier Handles <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>`
belonging to the keyframe.

.. figure:: /images/animation_keyframes_introduction_interpolation.png
   :align: right

   From top: summary, Bézier, linear.

.. list-table::

   * - Circle
     - Auto Clamped (default)
   * - Circle With Dot
     - Automatic
   * - Square
     - Vector
   * - Clipped Diamond
     - Aligned
   * - Diamond
     - Free

If the handles of a keyframe have different types,
or in case of summary rows representing multiple curves,
out of the available choices the icon that is furthest down the list is used.
This means that if a grouped row uses a circle icon,
it is guaranteed that none of the grouped channels have a non-auto key.

Horizontal green lines mark the use of
non-Bézier :ref:`Interpolation <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation>`.
The line is dimmed in summary rows if not all grouped channels have the same interpolation.

Display of this information can be disabled via the *Show Handles and Interpolation*
option of the Dope Sheet's :ref:`View Menu <dope-sheet-view-menu>`.
