************************
Camera Solver Constraint
************************

The *Camera Solver* constraint gives the owner of this constraint,
the location and rotation of the "solved camera motion".

The "solved camera motion" is where Blender reconstructs the position of the physical, real-world camera,
when it filmed the video footage, relative to the thing being tracked.

.. note::

   This constraint only works after you have set up a minimum of eight markers and pressed
   :ref:`Solve Camera Motion <editors-movie-clip-tracking-clip-solve-motion>`
   (:menuselection:`Movie Clip Editor --> Toolbar --> Solve --> Solve Camera Motion`).

   If unchecked, an option appears to choose from the other clips.

Constraint to F-Curve
   Applies the constraint, creating Keyframes for the transforms.

Influence
   Controls the percentage of affect the constraint has on the object.
   See :ref:`common constraint properties <bpy.types.constraint.influence>` for more information.
