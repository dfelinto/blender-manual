Actions
*******

When animating objects and properties in Blender, Actions record and contain the data.
As everything else in Blender, Actions are data-blocks.

.. figure:: /images/animation_actions_data3.png

   Actions.

So when you animate an object by changing its location with keyframes,
the animation is saved to the Action.

Each property has a channel which it is recorded to, for example,
``Cube.location.x`` is recorded to Channel X Location.
The *X location* and *Y location* properties can be shared across multiple objects,
if all objects have *X location* and *Y location* properties beneath them.

   Graph Editor. Each channel has an F-curve represented by the lines between the keyframes.

Actions
   Record and contain animation data.
Groups
   Are groups of channels.
Channels
   Record properties.
F-Curves
   :doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>` are used to
   interpolate the difference between the keyframes.
Keyframes
   :doc:`Keyframes </animation/keyframes/introduction>` are used to
   set the values of properties bound to a point in time.

Working with Actions
====================

.. figure:: /images/animation_actions_create.png
   :align: right

   The Action data-block menu.

When you first animate an object by adding keyframes,
Blender creates an *Action* to record the data.

*Actions* can be managed with the *Action data-block menu*
in the Dope Sheet :doc:`Action Editor </editors/dope_sheet/action>` header,
or the Sidebar region of the :doc:`NLA Editor </editors/nla/sidebar>`.

If you are making multiple actions for the same object,
press the shield button for each action.
This will give the actions a *Fake User* and will make Blender save the unlinked actions.

Objects can only use one *Action* at a time for editing.
The :doc:`NLA Editor </editors/nla/index>` is used to blend multiple actions together.

Bake Action
===========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    3D Viewport
   :Mode:      Object and Pose Modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object/Pose --> Animation --> Bake Action...`

The final motion of objects or bones depends not only on the keyframed animation,
but also on any active F-curve modifiers, drivers, and constraints.
On each frame of all the scene's frames, the *Bake Action* tool computes
the final animation of the selected objects or bones with all those
modifiers, drivers, and constraints applied, and keyframes the result.

This can be useful for adding deviation to a cyclic action like a :term:`Walk Cycle`,
or to create a keyframe animation created from drivers or constraints.
