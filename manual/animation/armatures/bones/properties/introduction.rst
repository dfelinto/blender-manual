   :Mode:      Object Mode, Edit Mode and Pose Mode
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Properties --> Bone`

When bones are selected (hence in *Edit Mode* and *Pose Mode*), their
properties are shown in the *Bone* tab of the Properties.
This shows different panels used to control features of each selected bone;
the panels change depending on which mode you are working in.
