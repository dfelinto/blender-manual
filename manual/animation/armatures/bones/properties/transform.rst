             The Transform panel (Pose Mode).

When in *Edit Mode* you can use this panel to control position and roll of individual bones.
Whereas in *Pose Mode* you can only set location for the main bone, and you can now set rotation and scale.

In addition, in *Pose Mode* it is possible to restrict changes in position,
rotation and scale by axis on each bone in the armature.
