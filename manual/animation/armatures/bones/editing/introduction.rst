Introduction
************

As with any other object, you edit your armature in *Edit Mode* :kbd:`Tab`.

The set of bone editing tools is quite similar to the one for
:doc:`mesh </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` editing.

.. important::

   One important thing to understand about armature editing is that you
   edit the *rest position* of your armature, i.e. its "default state".
   An armature in its *rest position* has all bones with *no* rotation and scaled to 1.0 in their own local space.

The different :doc:`poses </animation/armatures/posing/index>`
you might create afterwards are based on this rest position.
So if you modify it in *Edit Mode*, all the poses already existing will also be modified.
Thus you should in general be sure that your armature is definitive before starting to
:doc:`skin </animation/armatures/skinning/index>` and :doc:`pose </animation/armatures/posing/index>` it!

.. note::

   Please note that some tools work on bones' joints, while others work on bones themselves.
   Be careful not to get confused.


Add Menu

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Add`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-A`

In the 3D Viewport, :kbd:`Shift-A` to add a new bone to your armature.

This bone will be:

- Of one unit of length.
- Oriented towards the global Z axis.
- With its root placed at the 3D cursor position.
- With no relationship with any other bone of the armature.

Locking Bones
=============

You can prevent a bone from being transformed in *Edit Mode* in several ways:

.. The active bone can be locked clicking on *Lock*
   in the *Transform* panel (3D Viewport Sidebar):

- All bones can be locked clicking on the *Lock* checkbox
  of their Transform panel in the *Bones* tab;
- Press :kbd:`Shift-W` :menuselection:`Toggle Bone Options --> Locked`
- Select :menuselection:`Armature --> Bone Settings --> Toggle a Setting`.

*If the root of a locked bone is connected to the tip of an unlocked bone, it will not be locked*,
i.e. you will be able to move it to your liking.
This means that in a chain of connected bones, when you lock one bone,
you only really lock its tip. With unconnected bones, the locking is effective on both joints of the bone.
