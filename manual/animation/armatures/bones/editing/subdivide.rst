You can subdivide bones, to get two or more bones where there was just one bone.
The tool will subdivide all selected bones, preserving the existing relationships:
the bones created from a subdivision always form a connected chain of bones.

To create an arbitrary number of bones from each selected bone
in the Subdivide Multi :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel.

Number of Cuts
   Specifies the number of cuts. As in mesh editing,
   if you set *n* cuts, you will get *n* + 1 bones for each selected bone.

          An armature with one selected bone, just before multi-subdivision.

          The selected bone has been "cut" two times, giving three sub-bones.
