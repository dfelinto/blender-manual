   Skeleton panel.

In this panel you can arrange sets of bones into different layers for easier manipulation.

.. _bpy.types.Armature.pose_position:

Pose Position
   A radio button to switch between Pose Position and Rest Position.

   In *Edit Mode*, you always see armatures in their rest position,
   in *Object Mode* and *Pose Mode*, by default, you see them in *Pose Position*
   (i.e. as it was transformed in the *Pose Mode*).
   If you want to see it in the rest position in all modes, select *Rest Position*.

.. _bpy.types.Armature.layers:

Armature Layers
   Each armature has 32 layers to organize armatures by "regrouping" them into sets of bones.
   Only bones in active layers will be visible/editable, but they will always be effective
   (i.e. move objects or deform geometry), whether in an active layer or not.
   This property changes which layers are visible in the 3D Viewport.
   To show several layers at once, :kbd:`Shift-LMB` on the desired layers to view.
   To move bones to a given layer, use :ref:`bpy.ops.armature.bone_layers`.

.. _bpy.types.Armature.layers_protected:

Protected Layers
   You can lock a given bone layer for all :ref:`proxies <object-proxy>`
   of your armature, i.e. all bones in this layer will not be editable.

   .. note::

      *Protected Layers* in proxy are restored to proxy settings on file reload and undo.
