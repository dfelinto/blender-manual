Introduction

An armature in Blender can be thought of as similar to the armature of a real skeleton,
and just like a real skeleton an armature can consist of many bones.
These bones can be moved around and anything that they are attached to or
associated with will move and deform in a similar way.

An "armature" is a type of object used for rigging.
A rig is the controls and strings that move a marionette (puppet).
Armature object borrows many ideas from real-world skeletons.


Your First Armature
===================

In order to see what we are talking about, let us try to add the default armature in Blender.

(Note that armature editing details are explained in
the :doc:`armatures editing section </animation/armatures/bones/editing/index>`.)

Open a default scene, then:

#. Delete all objects in the scene.
#. Make sure the cursor is in the world origin with :kbd:`Shift-C`.
#. Press :kbd:`Numpad1` to see the world in Front view.
#. Add a *Single Bone* (:menuselection:`Add --> Armature`).
#. Press :kbd:`NumpadDelete` to see the armature at maximum zoom.

The Armature Object
===================

As you can see, an armature is like any other object type in Blender:

- It has an origin, a position, a rotation and a scale factor.
- It has an Object Data data-block, that can be edited in *Edit Mode*.
- It can be linked to other scenes, and the same armature data can be reused on multiple objects.
- All animation you do in *Object Mode* is only working on the whole object,
  not the armature's bones (use the *Pose Mode* to do this).

As armatures are designed to be posed, either for a static or animated scene,
they have a specific state, called "rest position". This is the armature's default "shape",
the default position/rotation/scale of its bones, as set in *Edit Mode*.

In *Edit Mode*, you will always see your armature in rest position,
whereas in *Object Mode* and *Pose Mode*,
you usually get the current "pose" of the armature
(unless you enable the *Rest Position* button of the *Armature* panel).
