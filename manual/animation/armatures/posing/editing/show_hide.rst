   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Properties --> Bone --> Viewport Display`
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`... --> Show/Hide`

You do not have to use bone layers to show/hide some bones. As with objects,
vertices or control points, you can use :kbd:`H`:

- :kbd:`H` will hide the selected bone(s).
- :kbd:`Shift-H` will hide all bones *but the selected one(s)*.
- :kbd:`Alt-H` will show all hidden bones.

You can also use the *Hide* checkbox of the :menuselection:`Bone tab --> Viewport Display panel`.

Note that hidden bones are specific to a mode,
i.e. you can hide some bones in *Edit Mode*,
they will still be visible in *Pose Mode*, and vice versa.
Hidden bones in *Pose Mode* are also invisible in *Object Mode*.
And in *Edit Mode*, the bone to hide must be fully selected,
not just its root or tip.
