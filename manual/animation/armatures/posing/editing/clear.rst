   :Mode:      Pose Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Pose --> Clear Transform`

Once you have transformed some bones, if you want to return to their rest position,
just clear their transformations.

.. _bpy.ops.pose.transforms_clear:

All
   Resets location, rotation, and scaling of selected bones to their default values.

.. _bpy.ops.pose.loc_clear:
.. _bpy.ops.pose.rot_clear:
.. _bpy.ops.pose.scale_clear:

Location, Rotation, Scale :kbd:`Alt-G`, :kbd:`Alt-R`, :kbd:`Alt-S`
   Clears individual transforms.

   Note that in *Envelope* visualization, :kbd:`Alt-S` does not clear the scale,
   but rather scales the *Distance* influence area of the selected bones.
   (This is also available through the :menuselection:`Pose --> Scale Envelope Distance` menu entry,
   which is only effective in *Envelope* visualization, even though it is always available...)

.. _bpy.ops.pose.user_transforms_clear:

Reset Unkeyed
   Clears the transforms to their keyframe state.

   Only Selected
      Operate on just the selected or all bones.
