Selecting

This page discusses selection tools that are specific to the 3D Viewport.
The generic selection tools are described in the
:doc:`Interface </interface/selecting>` section.

The 3D Viewport has two keys that affect selection:

Select by Origin :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Selects objects by their :doc:`origin </scene_layout/object/origin>`
   rather than their geometry.
Selection Menu :kbd:`Alt`
   Shows a menu in case there are multiple objects under the mouse cursor,
   making it easier to select the one you want.

These keys can be combined to get a selection menu based on object origins.

The mode-specific selection pages are listed below.
