Selecting

This page discusses specific selecting tools for the 3D Viewport.
The 3D Viewport also uses the general select tools used which are described
in the :doc:`interface section </interface/selecting>`.

Center Point :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Selects the object by its center point rather than its contents.
Menu :kbd:`Alt`
   If the objects are overlapping in the view, a menu of objects under the cursor
   can be used, so you can pick the object by it's name.

These can be combined so you can for example toggle the selection from an objects center point.

.. note::

   Right-click-select (see :ref:`Select With Mouse Button <keymap-blender_default-prefs-select_with>` option)
   has the advantage that selection is possible without having to switch to the select tool.
