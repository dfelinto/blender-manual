   :Header:    |pivot-icon| :menuselection:`Pivot Point --> 3D Cursor`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Period`

The 3D cursor is the most intuitive of the pivot points.
With the 3D cursor selected as the active pivot point
(from either the *Editor's Header* or via :kbd:`Period`),
simply position the 3D cursor and then do the required transformation. All rotation and
scaling transformations will now be done relative to the location of the 3D cursor.


Example
=======

The image below shows the difference when rotating an object
around the median point (right) and around the 3D cursor (left).
