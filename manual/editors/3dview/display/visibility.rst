Object Type Visibility

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Header:    |visibility-icon| :menuselection:`View Object Types`

This popover lets you control the visibility and selectability of the various object types.
For example, you can hide all the Lights in the scene with one click.

The settings only apply to the current 3D Viewport. Object types marked as unselectable
can still be selected in other viewports and in the
:doc:`Outliner </editors/outliner/introduction>`, for example.

.. seealso ::
   Outliner :ref:`Restriction Columns <editors-outliner-interface-restriction_columns>`
   for making individual objects invisible or unselectable across all viewports.
