Viewpoint
*********

The menu :menuselection:`View --> Viewpoint` lets you align the viewing direction to
a specific axis. This can also be done using the :ref:`Navigation Gizmo <navigation-gizmo>`
or the following hotkeys:

:Top: :kbd:`Numpad7`
:Front: :kbd:`Numpad1`
:Right: :kbd:`Numpad3`

:Bottom: :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad7`
:Back: :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad1`
:Left: :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad3`

The above hotkeys align the view to a global (world) axis. You can also align to a local axis
of the selected item by additionally holding :kbd:`Shift`. This way, you can for example
view any mesh face head-on, no matter how it's oriented.
(To get out of this local viewpoint, simply align to a global axis again.)

The view can also be aligned by holding :kbd:`Alt-MMB` and dragging the mouse in a certain direction.
