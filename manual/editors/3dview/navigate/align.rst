.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Align View`

These options allow you to align and orient the view.

Align View to Active
   Aligns the view to a certain local axis of the active object, bone, or (in Edit Mode)
   the normal of the active face. The view also becomes orthographic.
   
   To return to the regular (untilted) perspective view, you can first press :kbd:`Numpad3`
   to align to the global X axis, then orbit with :kbd:`MMB`.

Align Active Camera to View :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Numpad0`
   Moves and rotates the active camera so it matches the current viewpoint.

Align Active Camera to Selected
   Moves the active camera (without changing its orientation) so that its view
   frames the selected objects.

Center Cursor and Frame All :kbd:`Shift-C`
   Moves the :doc:`3D Cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>` back to the world origin
   and changes the view so that you can see everything in your scene.

Center View to Cursor
   Centers the view on the 3D Cursor.

View Lock to Active
   Centers the view on the active object and makes it the point of interest. The view
   will continue orbiting around it even if you pan to a different location.

View Lock Clear
   Returns the view to how it was before using *View Lock to Active*.
