   The Outliner editor.

The *Outliner* is a list that organizes data in the blend-file,
i.e. the scene data, Video Sequencer data, or anything that gets stored in a blend-file.
The *Outliner* can be used to:

- View the data in the scene.
- Select and deselect objects in the scene.
- Hide or show an object in the scene.
- Enable or disable selection (to make an object "unselectable" in the 3D Viewport).
- Enable or disable the rendering of an object.
- Delete objects from the scene.
- Unlink data (equivalent to pressing the *X* button next to the name of a data-block).
- Manage collections in the scene.

.. (TODO) create new objects by drag & drop from the outliner

Each row in the *Outliner* shows a data-block. You can :kbd:`LMB` click the disclosure triangle to
the left of a name to expand the current data-block and see what other data-blocks it contains.
Holding :kbd:`Shift` when clicking on the disclosure triangle will expand child data-blocks recursively.
:kbd:`LMB` Clicking and dragging along disclosure triangles will expand or collapse multiple data-blocks.
