Soft
   This cuts the strip in two at the location of the click.
   This will result in two strips which use the same source, fitting the original strip's timing and length.
Hard
   Like *Soft Blade*, it cuts a strip in two distinct strips;
   but you will not be able to drag the endpoints to show the frames past the cut of each resulting strip.
