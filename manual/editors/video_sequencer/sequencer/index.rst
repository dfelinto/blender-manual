Sequencer
*********

The Sequencer is composed of two areas (see figure 1).
The *header* is shown in a yellow outline and the *timeline* with a red outline.
Optional, there can be a *Toolbar* at the left and a *Sidebar* at the right; in figure 1 they are collapsed.

Although the Sidebar and Toolbar belong to the Timeline area, they are discussed in a separate section.
