F-Curve modifiers are similar to object modifiers, in that they add non-destructive effects,
that can be adjusted at any time, and layered to create more complex effects.


Adding a Modifier
=================

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_sidebar_modifiers_panel.png

   Modifiers panel.

The F-curve modifier panel is located in the Sidebar region.
Select a curve by selecting one of its curve points, or by selecting the channel list.
Click on the *Add Modifier* menu to select a modifier.


Types of Modifiers
==================

.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Generator Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierGenerator:

Generator Modifier
------------------

Generator creates a Factorized or Expanded Polynomial function.
These are basic mathematical formulas that represent lines, parabolas,
and other more complex curves, depending on the values used.

Additive
   This option causes the modifier to be added to the curve, instead of replacing it by default.
Polynomial Order
   Specify the order of the polynomial, or the highest power of ``X`` for this polynomial.
   (Number of coefficients: 1.)

   Change the Coefficient values to change the shape of the curve.

   .. seealso::

      `The Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial>`__
      for more information on polynomials.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Built-in Function Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierFunctionGenerator:

Built-in Function Modifier
--------------------------

These are additional formulas, each with the same options to control their shape.
Consult mathematics reference for more detailed information on each function:

- Sine
- Cosine
- Tangent
- Square Root
- Natural Logarithm
- Normalized Sine (``sin(x)/x``)

Amplitude
   Adjusts the Y scaling.
Phase Multiplier
   Adjusts the X scaling.
Phase Offset
   Adjusts the X offset.
Value Offset
   Adjusts the Y offset.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Envelope Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierEnvelope:
.. _bpy.types.FModifierEnvelopeControlPoint:

Envelope Modifier
-----------------

Allows you to adjust the overall shape of a curve with control points.

Reference Value
   Set the Y value the envelope is centered around.
Min
   Lower distance from Reference Value for ``1:1`` default influence.
Max
   Upper distance from Reference Value for ``1:1`` default influence.

Add Point
   Add a set of control points. They will be created at the current frame.

Point
   Frame
      Set the frame number for the control point.
   Min
      Specifies the lower control point's position.
   Max
      Specifies the upper control point's position.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Cycles Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierCycles:

Cycles Modifier
---------------

Cycles allows you add cyclic motion to a curve that has two or more control points.
The options can be set for before and after the curve.

Cycle Mode
   Repeat Motion
      Repeats the curve data, while maintaining their values each cycle.
   Repeat with Offset
      Repeats the curve data, but offsets the value of the first point to the value of the last point each cycle.
   Repeat Mirrored
      Each cycle the curve data is flipped across the X axis.

Before, After Cycles
   Set the number of times to cycle the data. A value of 0 cycles the data infinitely.


Trivially Cyclic Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the *Cycle Mode* for both ends is set to either *Repeat Motion* or
*Repeat with Offset*, and no other options of the modifier are
changed from their defaults, it defines a simple infinite cycle.

This special case receives some additional support from other areas of Blender:

- Automatic BÃ©zier handle placement is aware of the cycle and adjusts to achieve a smooth transition.
- The :ref:`Cycle-Aware Keying <timeline-keying>` option can be enabled to take
  the cycle into account when inserting new keyframes.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Noise Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierNoise:

Noise Modifier
--------------

Modifies the curve with a noise formula.
This is useful for creating subtle or extreme randomness to animated movements,
like camera shake.

Blend Type
   Replace
      Adds a -0.5 to 0.5 range noise function to the curve.
   Add
      Adds a 0 to 1 range noise function to the curve.
   Subtract
      Subtracts a 0 to 1 range noise function to the curve.
   Multiply
      Multiplies a 0 to 1 range noise function to the curve.

Scale
   Adjust the overall size of the noise. Values further from 0 give less frequent noise.
Strength
   Adjusts the Y scaling of the noise function.
Offset
   Offsets the noise in time.
Phase
   Adjusts the random seed of the noise.
Depth
   Adjusts how detailed the noise function is.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Limits Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierLimits:

Limits Modifier
---------------

Limit curve values to specified X and Y ranges.

Minimum, Maximum X
   Cuts a curve off at these frames ranges, and sets their minimum value at those points.
Minimum, Maximum Y
   Truncates the curve values to a range.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Stepped Interpolation Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierStepped:

Stepped Interpolation Modifier
------------------------------

Gives the curve a stepped appearance by rounding values down within a certain range of frames.

Step Size
   Specify the number of frames to hold each frame.
Offset
   Reference number of frames before frames get held.
   Use to get hold for (1-3) vs (5-7) holding patterns.
Use Start Frame
   Restrict modifier to only act before its "end" frame.
Use End Frame
   Restrict modifier to only act after its "start" frame.
