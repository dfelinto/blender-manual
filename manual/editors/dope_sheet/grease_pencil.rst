Grease Pencil
*************

This Mode allows you adjust the timing of the :doc:`Grease Pencil object's </grease_pencil/index>`
animation frames. It is especially useful for animators blocking out shots,
where the ability to re-time blocking is one of the main purposes of the whole exercise.

This mode can be accessed by changing the Dope Sheet editor's *Mode* selector (found in the header to the far left)
to Grease Pencil.

To use this editor mode, make sure you have a :doc:`Grease Pencil object </grease_pencil/index>` selected.

Insert Keyframe
---------------

Insert Keyframe :kbd:`I` can be used for creating blank Grease Pencil frames at a particular frame.
It will create blank frames if *Additive Drawing* is disabled, otherwise
it will make a copy of the active frame on that layer, and use that.


Copying Frames
--------------

It is possible to copy frames from one layer to another,
or from object to object, using the *Copy* and *Paste* tools in the *Key* menu.
Note that keyframes will be pasted into selected layers, so make sure you have a destination layer selected.


Main View
=========

The keyframes can be manipulated like any other data in the *Dope Sheet*.
Interpolated keyframes (alias breakdowns) are visualized as smaller light blue points.


Sidebar
=======

The Sidebar contains a copy of the Grease Pencil :doc:`Layer Properties </grease_pencil/properties/layers>`.
