Introduction
************

The NLA editor, short for NonLinear Animation, can manipulate and repurpose :doc:`/animation/actions`,
without the tedium of handling keyframes. It is often used to make broad,
significant changes to a scene's animation, with relative ease.
It can also repurpose, chain together a sequence of motions, and "layered" actions, which make it easier to organize,
and version-control your animation.
