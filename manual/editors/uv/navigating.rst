Navigating
**********

The UV Editor has a 2D cursor. Its position can be changed by :kbd:`LMB` clicking in the UV editor
while the cursor tool is active. You can also manually adjust its position in the Sidebar region.
The range by default is from 0.0 to 1.0 starting from the lower left corner.
By enabling :ref:`Pixel Coordinates <bpy.types.SpaceUVEditor.show_pixel_coords>`,
the coordinates match the pixels in your image with XY(0, 0) located in the lower left corner.


2D Viewport
===========

Panning can be done by clicking the :kbd:`MMB` and dragging.

Zooming can be done by scrolling :kbd:`Wheel` up or down.
Also, as in the 3D Viewport, you can use :kbd:`NumpadPlus` or :kbd:`NumpadMinus` to zoom.
