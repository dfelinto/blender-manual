   Weight Paint Tools.

Blender provides a set of helper tools for Weight Painting.


.. _sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_subset:

.. rubric:: The Subset Option

Some of the tools also provide a Subset filter to restrict their functionality to only specific vertex groups
(in the :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel, displayed after the tool is called)
with following options:

- Active Group
- Selected Pose Bones
- Deform Pose Bones
- All Groups

All tools also work with Vertex Selection Masking and Face Selection Masking.
In these modes the tools operate only on selected vertices or faces.


.. _bpy.ops.paint.weight_from_bones:

Assign from Bone Envelopes
==========================

Apply the envelope weight of the selected bone(s) to the selected vertex group.


Assign Automatic from Bone
==========================

Apply from the selected bone(s) to the vertex group the same "auto-weighting" methods
as available in the Parent armature menu.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_normalize_all:

Normalize All
=============

For each vertex, this tool makes sure that the sum of the weights across
all vertex groups is equal to 1. This tool normalizes all of the vertex groups,
except for locked groups, which keep their weight values untouched.

Lock Active
   Keep the values of the active group while normalizing all the others.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_normalize:

Normalize
=========

This tool only works on the active vertex group. All vertices keep their relative weights,
but the entire set of weights is scaled up such that the highest weight value is 1.0.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_normalize-example.png

   Normalize example.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_mirror:

Mirror
======

The *Mirror Vertex Group* tool mirrors the weights from one side of a perfectly symmetrical mesh
to the opposite side. Only mirroring along local X axis is supported.
Those vertices that have no corresponding vertex on the other side will not be affected.
But note, the weights are not transferred to the corresponding opposite bone weight group.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_mirror-example.png

   Mirror example.

Mirror Weights
   With this option checked, every selected vertex receives
   the weight information of its symmetrical counterpart.
   If both vertices are selected, it will be a weight information exchange;
   if only one is selected, information from the unselected will overwrite the selected one.
   Information on weight is passed for the active group only,
   unless *All Groups* is checked, in which case it is passed for all groups.
Flip Group Names
   Works with selected vertices that belong to vertex groups with "symmetrical names"
   (with components like "L", "R", "right", "left").
   All selected vertices that belong to the active group, or to the symmetrical of the active group,
   will have their assignation to that group replaced by an assignation to the symmetrical one;
   however, its weight will be preserved.
   If *All Groups* is checked, all assignations to these kind of groups
   will be replaced by the symmetrical counterpart, also keeping the old weights.
All Groups
   Operate on all vertex groups, instead of the active one.
Topology Mirror
   Mirror for meshes which are not fully symmetric (approximate mirror).
   See :ref:`here <bpy.types.Mesh.use_mirror_topology>` for more information.

.. tip:: Mirror to Opposite Bone

   If you want to create a mirrored weight group for the opposite bone
   (of a symmetric character), then you can do this:

   #. Delete the target vertex group (where the mirrored weights will be placed).
   #. Create a copy of the source bone vertex group
      (the group containing the weights which you want to copy).
   #. Rename the new vertex group to the name of the target vertex group
      (the group you deleted above).
   #. Select the target vertex group and call the Mirror tool
      (use only the Mirror weights option and optionally *Topology Mirror* if your mesh is not symmetric).


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_invert:

Invert
======

Replaces each Weight of the selected weight group by Ã— -1.0 weight.

Examples:

- Original 1.0 converts to 0.0
- Original 0.5 remains 0.5
- Original 0.0 converts to 1.0

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_invert-example.png

   Invert.

Subset
   Restrict the tool to a subset.
   See above :ref:`The Subset Option <sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_subset>` about how subsets are defined.
Add Weights
   Add vertices that have no weight before inverting (these weights will all be set to 1.0).
Remove Weights
   Remove vertices from the vertex group if they are 0.0 after inverting.

.. note::

   Locked vertex groups are not affected.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_clean:

Clean
=====

Clean Vertex Group Weights unassigns vertices from
:doc:`Vertex Groups </modeling/meshes/properties/vertex_groups/index>`
whose weights are below the *Limit*. Removes weights below a given threshold.
This tool is useful for clearing your weight groups of very low (or zero) weights.

In the example shown, a cutoff value of 0.2 is used (see operator options below)
so all blue parts are cleaned out.

Note, the images use the *Show Zero weights* Active option
so that unreferenced Weights are shown in Black.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_clean-example.png

   Clean example.

Subset
   Restrict the tool to a subset.
   See above :ref:`The Subset Option <sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_subset>` for how subsets are defined.
Limit
   This is the minimum weight value that will be kept in the group.
   Weights below this value will be removed from the group.
Keep Single
   Ensure that the *Clean* tool will not create completely unreferenced vertices
   (vertices which are not assigned to any vertex group), so each vertex will
   keep at least one weight, even if it is below the limit value!


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_quantize:

Quantize
========

This operator uses a process known as `Quantization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization>`__
which takes the input weights and clamps each weight to a number of steps between (0 - 1),
so there is no longer a smooth gradient between values.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_quantize-example.png

   Quantize example (Steps = 2).

Steps
   The number of steps between 0 and 1 to quantize the weights into.
   For example 5 would allow the following weights ``[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]``.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_levels:

Levels
======

Adds an offset and a scale to all weights of the selected weight groups.
with this tool you can raise or lower the overall "heat" of the weight group.

.. note::

   No weight will ever be set to values above 1.0 or below 0.0 regardless of the settings.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_levels-example.png

   Levels example.

Subset
   Restrict the tool to a subset.
   See above :ref:`The Subset Option <sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_subset>` for how subsets are defined.
Offset
   A value from the range (-1.0 - 1.0) to be added to all weights in the vertex group.
Gain
   All weights in the Subset are multiplied with the gain.

.. note::

   Whichever *Gain* and *Offset* you choose,
   in all cases the final value of each weight will be clamped to the range
   (0.0 - 1.0). So you will never get negative weights or overheated areas
   (weight > 1.0) with this tool.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_smooth:

Smooth
======

.. tip::

   The Smooth tool only works when "Vertex selection masking for painting" is enabled.
   Otherwise the tool button is grayed out.

Blends the weights of selected vertices with adjacent unselected vertices.
This tool only works in vertex select mode.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth-example-1.png

To understand what the tool really does, let us take a look at a simple example.
The selected vertex is connected to four adjacent vertices
(marked with a gray circle in the image). All adjacent vertices are unselected.
Now the tool calculates the average weight of all connected **and** unselected vertices.
In the example this is:

:math:`(1 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 4 = 0.25`

This value is multiplied by the factor given in the Operator options (see below).

- If the factor is 0.0 then actually nothing happens at all and the vertex just keeps its value.
- If the factor is 1.0 then the calculated average weight is taken (0.25 here).
- Dragging the factor from 0 to 1 gradually changes from the old value to the calculated average.

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth-example-2.png

Now let us see what happens when we select all
but one of the neighbors of the selected vertex as well.
Again all connected and unselected vertices are marked with a gray circle.
When we call the Smooth tool now and set the Factor to 1.0,
then we see different results for each of the selected vertices:

- The top-most and bottom-most selected vertices:

  are surrounded by three unselected vertices, with an average weight of :math:`(1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.333`
  So their color has changed to light green.

- The middle vertex:

  is connected to one unselected vertex with ``weight = 1``.
  So the average weight is 1.0 in this case, thus the selected vertex color has changed to red.

- The right vertex:

  is surrounded by three unselected vertices with average weight = :math:`(0 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.0`
  So the average weight is 0, thus the selected vertex color has not changed at all
  (it was already blue before Smooth was applied).

.. figure:: /images/sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_smooth-example-3.png

Finally let us look at a practical example.
The middle edge loop has been selected
and it will be used for blending the left side to the right side of the area.

- All selected vertices have two unselected adjacent vertices.
- The average weight of the unselected vertices is :math:`(1 + 0) / 2 = 0.5`
- Thus when the *Factor* is set to 1.0 then the edge loop turns to
  green and finally does blend the cold side (right) to the hot side (left).

Factor
   The effective amount of blending.
   When Factor is set to 0.0 then the `Smooth`_ tool does not do anything.
   For Factor > 0 the weights of the affected vertices gradually shift from their original value
   towards the average weight of all connected **and** unselected vertices (see examples above).
Iterations
   Number of times to repeat the smoothing operation.
Expand/Contract
   Positive values expand the selection to neighboring vertices while contract limits to the selection.
Source
   The vertices to mix with.

   All
      Smoothing will smooth both selected and deselected vertices.
   Only Selected
      Smoothing will only smooth with selected vertices.
   Only Deselected
      Smoothing will only smooth with deselected vertices.


Transfer Weights
================

Copy weights from other objects to the vertex groups of the active object.

By default this tool copies only the active (selected) vertex group of the source object
to the active vertex group of target object or creates a new one if the group does not exist.
However, you can change the tool's behavior in the :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel.

For example, to transfer all existing vertex groups from the source objects to the target,
change the *Source Layers Selection* option to *By Name*.

.. note::

   This tool uses the generic "data transfer", but transfers from all selected objects to active one.
   Please refer to the :doc:`Data Transfer </scene_layout/object/editing/relations/transfer_mesh_data>`
   docs for options details and explanations.


Prepare the Copy
----------------

You first select all source objects, and finally the target object
(the target object must be the active object).

It is important that the source objects and the target object are at the same location.
If they are placed side-by-side, then the weight transfer will not work. (See the *Vertex Mapping* option.)
You can place the objects on different layers,
but you have to ensure that all objects are visible when you call the tool.

Now ensure that the target object is in Weight Paint Mode.
Open the Toolbar and call the *Transfer Weights* tool in the *Weight Tools* panel.


Adjust Last Operation Panel Confusion
-------------------------------------

You may notice that the :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel stays available
after the weight transfer is done. The panel only disappears
when you call another Operator that has its own :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel.
This can lead to confusion when you use Transfer weights repeatedly after you changed your vertex groups.
If you then use the still-visible :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel,
then Blender will reset your work to its state right before you initially called the *Transfer Weights* tool.

So when you want to call the *Transfer Weights* tool again after you made some changes to your
vertex groups, then **always** use the *Transfer Weights* button,
even if the :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel is still available.
Unless you really want to reset your changes to the initial call of the tool.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_limit_total:

Limit Total
===========

Reduce the number of weight groups per vertex to the specified Limit.
The tool removes lowest weights first until the limit is reached.

.. hint::

   The tool can only work reasonably when more than one weight group is selected.

Subset
   Restrict the tool to a subset.
   See above :ref:`The Subset Option <sculpt-paint_weight-paint_editing_subset>` for how subsets are defined.
Limit
   Maximum number of weights allowed on each vertex.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_fix:

Fix Deforms
===========

The *Fix deforms* tool is used to modify an object's nonzero weights so its deformed
vertices are at a new defined distance. This is helpful to fix deformations
because when complex models are deformed to their extreme poses,
they are often visibly bumpy, jagged, or otherwise incorrectly deformed.
Using this tool, you can smooth over the deformation.

To use the tool, select the vertices that you would like to move,
either in Edit Mode or by using the vertex selection/mask.
The operator can now be used and altered with these options:

Distance
   The distance to move to.
Strength
   The distance moved can be changed by this factor.
Accuracy
   Changes the amount weights are altered with each iteration: lower values are slower.

.. note::

   Note that if it does not change, then there are no nonzero bone weights
   that are changed to make it closer to the intended distance.


.. _bpy.ops.object.vertex_group_lock:
