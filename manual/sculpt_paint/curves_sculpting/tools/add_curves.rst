Add Curves
**********

Used to distribute new curves on the surface mesh.
This tool requires the curve to have a :doc:`Surface </sculpt_paint/curves_sculpting/introduction>`,
commonly used for hair scalp.

The curves follow the Surface normals and can be used to expand existent curve interpolating their characteristics.


Brush Settings
==============

Count
   Number of curves added.

Curve Length
   Length of newly added curves when not interpolated.

Points Per Curve
  Number of Control Points for the new created curves when the shape is not interpolated.

.. note::

   Interpolation allows to add hair which is already combed. The new hair is then created
   following the previously created hair which are in the vicinity.

Interpolate Length
   Use length of the curves in close proximity.

Interpolate Shape
   Use shape and the amount of control points of the curves in close proximity.

Interpolate Point Count
   Use the amount of control points of the curves in close proximity.
