Vertex Paint Tools
******************

Draw
   Paints a specified color over the object.

Blur
   Smooths out the colors of adjacent vertices. In this mode the Color
   Value is ignored. The strength defines how much the colors are blurred.

Average
   Smooths color by painting the average resulting color from all colors under the brush.

Smear
   Smudges colors by grabbing the colors under the brush and "dragging" them.
   This can be imagined as a finger painting tool.

   Draw free-hand annotation.

   Annotate Line
      Draw straight line annotation.
   Annotate Polygon
      Draw a polygon annotation.
   Annotate Eraser
      Erase previous drawn annotations.
