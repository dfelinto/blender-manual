   :align: right

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/draw`
   Moves vertices inward or outward based on the average normal.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/draw_sharp`
   Move vertices inward or outward based the original coordinates
   and uses the *Sharper* :doc:`Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>`.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/clay`
   Similar to the *Draw* brush, but includes settings to adjust the plane on which the brush acts.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/clay_strips`
   The same as the *Clay* brush, but it uses a cube to define the brush area of influence rather than a sphere.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/layer`
   Moves all vertices to an exact height creating a flat layer.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/inflate`
   Displaces the mesh in the direction of the vertex normals.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/blob`
   Pushes mesh outward or inward into a spherical shape.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/crease`
   Creates sharp indents or ridges by pushing or pulling the mesh, while pinching the vertices together.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/smooth`
   Eliminates irregularities in the mesh by averaging the positions of the vertices.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/flatten`
   Smooths vertices to a flat plane by finding an average height and moves vertices towards that height.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/fill`
   Brings vertices below the brush plane upwards.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/scrape`
   Brings vertices above the plane downwards.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/multiplane_scrape`
   Scrapes the mesh with two angled planes at the same time, producing a sharp edge between them.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/pinch`
   Pulls vertices towards the center of the brush.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/grab`
   Selects a group of vertices and pulls them to follow the mouse.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/elastic_deform`
   Used to simulate realistic deformations such as grabbing or twisting of :term:`Elastic` objects.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/snake_hook`
   Pulls vertices along with the movement of the brush to create long, snake-like forms.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/thumb`
   Flattens the mesh in the brush area, while moving it in the direction of the brush stroke.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/pose`
   Poses a model simulating an armature-like deformations.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/nudge`
   Moves vertices in the direction of the brush stroke.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/rotate`
   Rotates vertices within the brush in the direction the cursor is moved.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/slide_relax`
   Slides the topology of the mesh in the direction of the stroke
   without changing the geometrical shape of the mesh.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/boundary`
   Transforms and deforms the mesh boundaries.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/cloth`
   Simulates cloth that can be sculpted.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/simplify`
   Cleans up geometry by collapsing short edges.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/mask`
   Lets you select mesh parts to be unaffected by other brushes by painting vertex colors.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/multires_displacement_eraser`
   Deletes displacement information applied on a Multiresolution modifier.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/box_trim`
   Creates a mask based on box select.

   :doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/lasso_trim`
      Creates a mask based on lasso select.

   :doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/line_mask`
      Creates a mask based on a line.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/box_face_set`
   Creates a face set based on box select.

   :doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/lasso_face_set`
      Creates a face set based on lasso select.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/box_trim`
   Performs a Boolean operation based on box select.

   :doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/lasso_trim`
      Performs a Boolean operation based on lasso select.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/line_project`
   Flattens geometry along a drawn line.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/mesh_filter`
   Applies a deformation to all vertices in the mesh at the same time.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/cloth_filter`
   Applies a cloth simulation to all vertices in the mesh at the same time.

:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools/edit_face_set`
   Modifies the face set under the cursor.
