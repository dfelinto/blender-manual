This brush slides the topology of the mesh to areas that require more detail.
The brush does this while minimizing changes to the geometrical shape of the mesh.
When pressing :kbd:`Shift`, the brush enters *Relax* mode
which tries to create an even distribution of quads without deforming the volume of the mesh.
