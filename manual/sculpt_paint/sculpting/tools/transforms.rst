Tool Settings
=============

Each tool has the following settings to change how the unmasked mesh will be transformed.

Transform Mode
   How the transformation is going to be applied to the target.

   :All Vertices:
      Applies the transformation to all vertices in the mesh.
   :Elastic:
      Applies the transformation while dynamically simulating elasticity.
      Instead of applying this to all vertices, it uses the radius of the cursor as the area of effect.
