The *Flatten* brush determines an "area plane"
located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area.
The vertices are then pulled towards this plane.
The inverse of the *Flatten* brush is the *Contrast* brush
which pushes vertices up or down away from the brush plane.
