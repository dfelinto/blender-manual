The Simplify brush is a special brush that is used in conjunction with
:doc:`/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tool_settings/dyntopo`
to remove detail in overly dense portions of the mesh.
This brush collapses short edges as defined by the Dyntopo's *Detail Size*
regardless of the :ref:`Refine Method <bpy.types.Sculpt.detail_refine_method>`.

This brush has no effect if dynamic topology is not enabled.
