Bleed
   Seam Bleed extends the paint beyond UV island bounds to avoid visual artifacts
   (like bleed for baking).
Dither
   Amount of dithering when painting on 8 bit images.
Occlude
   With Geometry occlusion active only exposed (not hidden by other mesh parts) pixels are affected.
   This also allows for 3D stencils to be used to mask out areas of the surface too.
Backface Culling
   With backface culling enabled you can only paint on the front side of faces.
