*****************
Adding a Language
*****************

Preparations
============

If the language you want to translate has not been started by someone else already and
you wish to create a set of new files for the desired language, say 'fr' (French),
then you must first use the environment you have created,
as guided in :ref:`Getting Started <about-getting-started>`,
in particular :doc:`/about/contribute/install/index` and :doc:`/about/contribute/build/index` sections.

This will give you a foundation environment for:

- Creating a new set of translation language from English source.
- Perform ``make`` command to turn translated texts in po files into html files for testing locally.
- Update changes in English texts which have been added by other contributors.

Below examples show the process to create a new set of files for French, language code ``fr``, on Linux platform.
Other platforms might vary slightly but should be mainly the same.

#. Goto ``https://developer.blender.org`` to create an account for yourself and
   become a developer/translator for the Blender organization.
#. Login the account and create a task with ``todo`` type, addressing an administrator in the *Subscribers* field,
   requesting for a committer right in order to transfer changes to the central repository of the translation team.
#. Open an instance of the console application, such as Gnome-Terminal emulator.
#. Change the current working directory to the directory of ``blender_docs``,
   where the instance of ``Makefile`` resides.


Trying the Make Process to Create HTML Files in English
=======================================================

#. Ensure the previous instance of ``build`` directory is removed, if any exists::

      make clean

#. Convert all the ``rst`` files into ``pot`` translation files::

      make gettext

#. Create ``html`` files::

      make html

#. After this, you can actually view the created html files locally following the prompted instruction, such as::

      xdg-open <path to your English manual>/blender_docs/build/html/index.html


Creating the Language Entry in the HTML Menu
============================================

#. Create an entry for the language in the html menu by opening file ``./resources/theme/js/version_switch.js``
   (assuming you are at the ``blender_docs`` subdirectory).
#. Find the table for the languages in ``var all_langs = {..};``.
#. Enter the entry: ``"fr": "Fran&ccedil;ais",``, (``"fr": "Fran√ßais"``).
   (Notice the Unicode characters.)
#. To find out about changes in the local repository::

      svn status

#. Enter your password::

      svn commit --username <your username> -m "your comment"

#. Bring your local repository up to the most recent version of changes, including the one you have just done::

      svn update .


Setting the Local Configuration File
====================================

#. Open a text editor to enter the following texts,
   change the language code to whatever the language you will be translating:

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:

      language = 'fr'
      locale_dirs = ['locale/']
      gettext_compact = True

#. Save this file as ``conf.py`` in the ``blender_docs`` directory, where ``Makefile`` resides.
#. Tells ``svn`` to ignore this file when performing operations by executing this shell command::

      svn propset svn:ignore conf.py .


Generating the Set of Files for the Target Language
===================================================

#. Check out the current translation repository using the command::

      svn checkout https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-manual-translations/trunk/blender_docs/locale

   This will download all language sets available in the repository into the ``locale`` directory of your drive.
   You can go to the ``locale`` directory to see the hidden subdirectory ``.svn`` within it,
   together with directories of languages.
   You'll need to add your own set of files for the language you're trying to translating to.

#. From the ``blender_docs`` directory to generate a set of files for ``fr`` language::

      make gettext
      sphinx-intl update -p build/locale -l fr

   These files are still in English only, with all ``msgstr`` entries blank.

#. Submit new set of files to the central repository::

      cd locale
      svn add fr
      svn commit --username <your username> -m "Initial commit language set of files for French"

#. You don't need all other languages being there, so remove the locale directory for the time being::

      rm -fr locale

   We will download this new set of language as guided in the next section.

.. note::

   - It is recommended you make two environment variables for these directories, in the ``.bashrc``
     to make it more convenient for changing or scripting batch/shell commands
     for the process of translation and reviewing results::

        export BLENDER_MAN_EN=$HOME/<directory to make file directory above>/blender_docs
        export BLENDER_MAN_FR=$BLENDER_MAN_EN/locale

   - Newly generated files will contain some placeholders for authors and revision dates etc.
     If you find the job of replacing them repetitive, make use of the script ``change_placeholders.sh``
     in the subdirectory ``~/blender_docs/toos_maintenance``, make a copy of that to your local ``bin`` directory and
     replace all values that were mentioned in the file with your specific details,
     then after each change to a file, you would do following commands
     to update the file with your personal details, revision date and time,
     plus generating the html files for your language, which you can view using your Internet browser::

        $HOME/bin/change_placeholders.sh $BLENDER_MAN_FR
        make -d --trace -w -B -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='fr'" 2>&1
