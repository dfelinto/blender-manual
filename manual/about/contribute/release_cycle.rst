*************
Release Cycle
*************

A new Blender version is targeted to be released every 3 months.
The actual `release cycle <https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Release_Cycle>`__ for a specific release is longer,
and overlaps the previous and next release cycle.

Branches
========

Work is done in two branches:

- ``blender-v{VERSION}-release`` branch: fixes and other incremental improvements.
- ``master`` branch: documentation for new features and improvements for the release after that.

The ``blender-v{VERSION}-release`` branch will be available for 5 weeks prior to the release date.
At the same time ``master`` will be open for the next release,
giving 2 months to add documentation for new features of the next release, and another month to make improvements.


Switching Branches
------------------

To switch to the release branch use::

   svn switch https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-manual/branches/blender-{VERSION}-release/blender_docs/

To switch back to the development branch use::

   svn switch https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-manual/trunk/blender_docs/


Updating Branches
-----------------

To merge changes from the release branch to the development branch,
first switch to the development branch and use::

   svn merge https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-manual/branches/blender-{VERSION}-release/blender_docs/
   svn ci -m "Merge branch 'blender-{VERSION}-release'"


Bcon Phases
===========

Each Blender version has its own Bcon phase,
indicating which types of changes are allowed to be committed and what writers are focusing on.

That means for example that Blender 2.90 can be in Bcon3 (wrapping up),
while Blender 2.91 is in Bcon1 (new features and changes).

   * - Bcon1

     - New features and changes

     - 4-5 weeks

     - The first 5 weeks overlap with the Bcon3 and Bcon4 phases of the previous release,
       Writing focus will be split on fixes for the previous release
       and writing documentation for features already added or likely to be added to Blender.
       This is also the perfect time to make any larger or more disruptive improvements to the manual.

     - ``master``

   * - Bcon2

     - Improve and stabilize

     - 4 weeks

     - Work to improve, optimize and fix bugs in new and existing features.

     - ``master``

   * - Bcon3

     - Wrapping up
