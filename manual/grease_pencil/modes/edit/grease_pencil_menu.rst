Transform
=========

Strokes can be edited by transforming the locations of points.

Like other elements in Blender, points and strokes can be
moved :kbd:`G`, rotated :kbd:`R` or scaled :kbd:`S` as described in
the :doc:`Basic Transformations </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/introduction>` section.
When in *Edit Mode*,
:doc:`Proportional Editing </editors/3dview/controls/proportional_editing>`
is also available for the transformation actions.

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Grease Pencil --> Clean Up --> Boundary Strokes`

Removes boundary strokes used by the *Fill* tool.
See :doc:`Fill tool </grease_pencil/modes/draw/tools/fill>` for more information.

Mode
   Active Frame Only
      Removes boundary strokes from the current frame.
   All Frames
      Removes boundary strokes from all frames.


Boundary Strokes All Frames
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Grease Pencil --> Clean Up --> Boundary Strokes all Frames`

.. _bpy.ops.gpencil.frame_clean_loose:

Delete Loose Points
-------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode

Removes unconnected points.


.. _bpy.ops.gpencil.stroke_merge_by_distance:

Merge by Distance
-----------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Grease Pencil --> Clean Up --> Merge by Distance`

*Merge by Distance* is a useful tool to simplify a stroke by merging
the selected points that are closer than a specified distance to each other.
Note, unless using *Unselected*, selected points must be contiguous,
else they will not be merged.

Merge Distance
   Sets the distance threshold for merging points.
Unselected
   Allows points in selection to be merged with unselected points.
   When disabled, selected points will only be merged with other selected ones.


.. _bpy.ops.gpencil.frame_clean_duplicate:

Delete Duplicate Frames
-----------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Grease Pencil --> Clean Up --> Delete Duplicated Frames`

Removes any duplicated animation frames.


.. _bpy.ops.gpencil.reproject:

Reproject Strokes
-----------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Grease Pencil --> Clean Up --> Reproject Strokes`

Sometimes you may have drawn strokes unintentionally in different locations in the 3D space
but they look right from a certain plane or from the camera view.
You can use Reproject Strokes to flatten all the selected strokes from a certain viewpoint.

Reprojected Type
   Front
      Reproject selected strokes onto the front plane (XZ).
   Side
      Reproject selected strokes onto the side plane (YZ).
   Top
      Reproject selected strokes onto the top plane (XY).
   View
      Reproject selected strokes onto the current view.
   Surface
      Reproject selected strokes onto the mesh surfaces.
   Cursor
      Reproject selected strokes onto 3D cursor rotation.

Keep Original
   Maintains the original strokes after applying the tool.

Frames
   Deletes all the strokes at the current frame and in the current layer/channel.

Dissolve :kbd:`Ctrl-X`
   Deletes the selected points without splitting the stroke.
   The remaining points in the strokes stay connected.

Dissolve between :kbd:`Ctrl-X`
   Deletes all the points between the selected points without splitting the stroke.
   The remaining points in the strokes stay connected.

Dissolve Unselect :kbd:`Ctrl-X`
   Deletes all the points that are not selected in the stroke without splitting the stroke.
   The remaining points in the strokes stay connected.
