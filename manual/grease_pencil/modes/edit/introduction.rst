Blender provides a variety of tools for editing Grease Pencil strokes.
These are tools used to add, duplicate, move and delete elements.

==============================

These are available through the different tools in the Toolbar,
the Stroke menu in the 3D Viewport header, and context menus in the 3D Viewport,
as well as individual shortcut keys.
