Painting needs paint brushes and Blender provides a Brush panel within the Toolbar
when in *Weight Paint Mode*.

Brush
   In the :ref:`Data-Block menu <ui-data-block>` you find predefined Brush presets.
   And you can create your own custom presets as needed.

Radius
   This option controls the radius of the brush, measured in pixels.
   :kbd:`F` allows you to change the brush size interactively by
   dragging the mouse and then :kbd:`LMB` (the texture of the brush should be visible inside the circle).
   Typing a number then enter while using :kbd:`F` allows you to enter the size numerically.

   Pressure
      Brush size can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
      if you are using a :ref:`Graphics Tablet <hardware-tablet>`.

Strength
   How powerful the brush is when applied.
