Draw
   Paints a specified color over the object.

Blur
   Smooths out the colors of adjacent vertices. In this mode the Color
   Value is ignored. The strength defines how much the colors are blurred.

Average
   Smooths color by painting the average resulting color from all colors under the brush.

Smear
   Smudges colors by grabbing the colors under the brush and "dragging" them.
   This can be imagined as a finger painting tool.

Replace
   Change the color only to the stroke points that already have vertex color applied.

:ref:`Annotate <tool-annotate-freehand>`
   Draw free-hand annotation.

   :ref:`Annotate Line <tool-annotate-line>`
      Draw straight line annotation.
   :ref:`Annotate Polygon <tool-annotate-polygon>`
      Draw a polygon annotation.
   :ref:`Annotate Eraser <tool-annotate-eraser>`
      Erase previous drawn annotations.
