When you are on a frame between two keyframes and click an drag a new breakdown keyframe will be added. This way you define
the final interpolation for the new stroke.

Usage
=====

Click and drag from left to right to set the desire interpolation percentage and release to confirm, a new breakdown keyframe will be added
