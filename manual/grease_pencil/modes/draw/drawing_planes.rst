   :Header:    :menuselection:`Drawing Planes`

The Drawing Planes selector helps to select
the plane in which the newly created strokes are drawn.

To see which plane you are using when drawing strokes,
you can enable *Canvas* in :ref:`Viewport Overlays <3dview-overlay-grease-pencil>`.
See :doc:`Viewport Display </interface/controls/templates/curve>` to know more about Canvas settings.

.. note::

   The Drawing Plane selected has effect only for new strokes and does not affect the existing ones.
