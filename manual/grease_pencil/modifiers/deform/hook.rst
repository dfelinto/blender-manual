Hook Modifier
*************

The *Hook* Modifier is used to deform stroke points using another object
(usually an empty or a bone but it can be any object).

As the hook moves, it pulls points from the strokes with it.
You can think of it as animated
:doc:`Proportional Editing </editors/3dview/controls/proportional_editing>`.

   This documentation refers to the Hook Modifier specific to the Grease Pencil object.
   For uses with other object types refer to the general :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/deform/hooks`.

   The Hook modifier.

Object
   The name of the object to hook points to.

Vertex Group
   Restricts the effect only to a vertex group.

Strength
   Adjust this hooks influence on the stroke points, were (0.0 to 1.0) (no change to fully follow the hook).


Falloff
-------

Type
   This can be used to adjust the type of curve for the Strength attenuation.
   You can also define a custom curve to get a much higher level of control.

Radius
   The size of the hooks influence.

Uniform Falloff
   This setting is useful when using hooks on scaled objects,
   especially in cases where non-uniform scale would stretch the result of the hook.


Influence
---------

See :ref:`grease-pencil-modifier-influence-filters`.

.. note::

   The Hook Modifier stores points indices from the original strokes to determine what to affect;
   this means that modifiers that generate geometry, like a Subdivision Surface Modifier,
   should always be applied **after** the Hook Modifier;
   otherwise the generated geometry will be left out of the hook's influence.


Example
