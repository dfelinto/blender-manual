Line Art Modifier
*****************

The *Line Art* modifier generates stylized line art from the scene or selected source collection or objects.

.. note::

   Due to lack of global cache at the moment, each Line Art modifier will run the entire
   occlusion calculation for itself. So if you have multiple line art modifiers to select
   different parts of the scene (to apply different styles, etc.), the evaluation will take much longer.
   There are plans to remedy this in the future, but this is a known limitation for now.


Options
=======

.. figure:: /images/grease-pencil_modifiers_generate_line-art_panel.png
   :align: right

   The Line Art modifier.

Source Type
   What type of geometry source should line art be generated from.

   Scene, Collection, Object

Source Selector
   Based on the source type, collection or object can be selected as source geometry.

.. note::

   Line Art will still load and calculate the entire visible scene to produce correct occlusion result,
   unless specified to do otherwise in object or collection Line Art *Usage* property.

Edge Types
   Line Art can identify different edge types. Selected edge types will be included in the result.

   Contour
      Where the edge becomes the separation line of front/backfacing faces.

   Material Borders
      Where the edge separates faces with different materials.

   Edge Marks
      Freestyle edge marks.

   Intersections
      Intersection lines between faces.

   Crease
      Where the edge angle is small enough. Controlled by *Crease Threshold* property.

Crease Threshold
   Edge angles that are smaller than this value will be treated as crease.

Target Layer
   The Grease Pencil :ref:`bpy.types.GPencilLayer` to put the result in.

Target Material
   The Grease Pencil :ref:`bpy.types.MaterialGPencilStyle` to generate strokes with.

Remove Doubles
   Perform an "merge by distance" operation when loading geometry into Line Art.
   The threshold of this operation is internally set to a value that is optimal for Line Art algorithm precision.

Overlapping Edges as Contour
   This option allows overlapping edges (e.g. from an edge split modifier or imported geometry where
   two edges occupy the exact same space) to be drawn as contour. Enabling this option will slow down
   the calculation slightly but it will handle edge overlapping cases without erroneous occlusion results.

Instanced Objects
   This option enables particles and other instanced objects to be loaded for line art calculation.
   There will be performance impact when there are a large amount of instanced objects in the scene.

Clipping Boundaries
   When enabled, line art will generate clipping lines as contour type at the place
   where near or far clipping planes cut the model. Otherwise there will be no lines.


Style

   Style subpanel.

Thickness
   The strokes generated by line art are given this thickness.

Opacity
   The strokes generated by line art are given this Opacity.


Occlusion
---------

.. figure:: /images/grease-pencil_modifiers_generate_line-art_occlusion-panel.png
   :align: right

   Occlusion subpanel.

Range
   If enabled, the modifier will select lines that have an occlusion level between start and end values.

Level
   Desired occlusion level to be selected as line art result. A value of 0 means visible lines (no occlusion).
   A value of 1 means selecting lines that have been occluded by exactly 1 layer of faces.

Transparency
   If enabled, Line Art will only select lines that are occluded by certain faces whose material
   have specific occlusion masks set.

Masks
   To select edges that have been occluded by selected masks.

Match All Masks
   If enabled, only lines that are occluded with the exact transparency bit combination will be selected.
   Otherwise, lines that have been occluded by any one of specified transparency masks will be selected.

   Demonstration of the usage of transparency masks.


Chaining
--------

.. figure:: /images/grease-pencil_modifiers_generate_line-art_chaining-panel.png
   :align: right

   Chaining subpanel.

Chain Intersection with Contour
   Allows intersection lines to be chained together with contour lines.

.. note::

   Enabling this option will lead to ambiguity in intersection edge types.
   Intersection lines that have not been able to chain with any nearby contour lines will remain
   as intersection lines.


Chain All Lines
   Enabling this option will cause all lines to have the type of contour and to be chained together.

Threshold
   Allow the end point of short segments to be chained together if the 2D image space distance
   between them are within the specified threshold.

Angle Splitting
   Split a chain at sharp "turning" points specified by this angle.


Vertex Weight Transfer
----------------------

.. figure:: /images/grease-pencil_modifiers_generate_line-art_vertex-weight-panel.png
   :align: right

   Vertex Weight Transfer subpanel.

Filter Source
   If source mesh has vertex groups whose name starts with this string, then the vertex weight info
   will be transferred into weight groups in Grease Pencil strokes.

Match Output
   Transfer the filtered object vertex weights into Grease Pencil weight groups with the same names
   as the filtered ones.

Target
   If *Match Output* is off, then a target vertex group has to be specified.
   If there are multiple weight groups copied into target, then the highest weight value is copied into it.


Baking
------

.. figure:: /images/grease-pencil_modifiers_generate_line-art_baking-panel.png
   :align: right

   Baking subpanel.

Bake Line Art
   Bakes Line Art strokes for active Grease Pencil object within the *start*, *end* frame range in scene.
   Bake Line Art (All) bakes all Grease Pencil objects that contains at least one Line Art modifier.
   After baking, baked Line Art modifier will be deactivated automatically.

Clear Baked Line Art
   Clears baked line art frames within the scene frame range for active Grease Pencil object.
   Clear Baked Line Art (All) applies the same operation for all Grease Pencil objects that
   contains at least one Line Art modifier.

   .. warning::

      If you have drawn anything manually in the frame range of where line art runs,
      this operation will also clear those strokes!

Continue without Clearing
   Re-activate a specific Line Art modifier without clearing baked strokes. This is useful for working
   on multiple portions of frames separately.
