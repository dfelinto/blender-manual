********************
Time Offset Modifier
********************

The *Time Offset* Modifier applies a temporal offset to Grease Pencil keyframes on your timeline.
If you have duplicated a Grease Pencil object you can use the Time Offset Modifier on the copies to
desynchronize their animation. This can give more natural looking results.

Using the Time Offset Modifier it's possible to have Grease Pencil frame ranges play back as repeating loops. 
Traditionally, 2D animation that uses looped drawings includes characters walking, rising smoke, and falling
rain. 
In Fixed Frame mode the Time Offset Modifier can display drawings on your timeline entirely independently of
the playhead position.

This can be handy for displaying drawings that will appear often in your animation. Think of switching between
predefined mouth shapes for instance.
