   Grease Pencil primitives.


Blank
=====

Adds a Grease Pencil object without any stroke.


Stroke
======

Adds a Grease Pencil object with a simple stroke as a reference.


Monkey
======

It creates a 2D monkey head. The Monkey's name is "Suzanne" and is Blender's mascot.
2D Suzanne is very useful as a standard test.

.. note:: Materials and 2D Layers

   Adding Stroke or Monkey primitives also adds a set of preset materials and 2D layers
   to help start drawing with the new object.
