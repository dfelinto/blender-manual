Annotation
**********

Annotation tool strokes can be enabled/disabled with the checkbox in the panel header.
It is a standard annotations panel where annotation layers and frames can be controlled.
There is one difference in the behavior of the annotation tools from other areas --
when a new layer is created "on-demand" (when making a stroke without adding a layer before this)
the default color for the layer is set to pink. This makes the stroke easy to notice on all kinds of movies.
