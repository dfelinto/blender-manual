Solve
=====

.. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingSettings.use_tripod_solver:

Tripod
   Tripod Motion can be used for footage where the camera does not move and only rotates.
   Such footage can't be tracked with a generic solver approach, and
   it is impossible to determine the actual feature points in space due to a lack of information.
   So this solver will solve only the relative camera rotation and then reproject the feature points into a sphere,
   with the same distance between feature and camera for all feature points.

   .. note::

      This is special type of camera solver and it behaves different from regular solver.
      It means using more tracks doesn't imply more accurate solution.
      Having 5-10 tracks on frame is likely what shall be commonly used for this kind of solver.

.. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingSettings.use_keyframe_selection:

Keyframe
   Automatically select keyframes for initial reconstruction.
   This option enables complex algorithms which tries to find a keyframe pair
   with minimal reconstruction error and best scene scale guess.

.. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingObject.keyframe_a:
.. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingObject.keyframe_b:

Keyframe A/B
   Start (A) and End (B) frame of the range used for reconstruction.


Refine
   Specifies which parameters should be refined during solve.
   Such refining is useful when you are not sure about some camera intrinsics,
   and solver should try to find the best parameter for those intrinsics.
   But you still have to know approximate initial values --
   it will fail to find correct values if they were set completely incorrectly initially.

   .. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingSettings.refine_intrinsics_focal_length:

   Focal Length
      Refine the camera's :ref:`Focal Length <bpy.types.MovieTrackingCamera.focal_length>`.

   .. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingSettings.refine_intrinsics_principal_point:

   Optical Center
      Refine the camera's :ref:`Optical Center <bpy.types.MovieTrackingCamera.principal>`.

   .. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingSettings.refine_intrinsics_radial_distortion:

   Radial Distortion
      Refine the camera's :ref:`Radial Distortion Parameters <bpy.types.MovieTrackingCamera.k>`.

   .. _bpy.types.MovieTrackingSettings.refine_intrinsics_tangential_distortion:

   Tangential Distortion
      Refine the camera's :ref:`Tangential Distortion Parameters <bpy.types.MovieTrackingCamera.brown_p>`.

Cleanup
=======

This panel contains operators and their settings which are needed to clean up bad tracks:
tracks which are not tracked long enough or which failed to reconstruct accurately.

Frames
   Tracks or tracked segments shorter than this number of frames will be removed.

Error
   Tracks which has reprojection error higher than this value will be removed.

Type
   Several actions can be performed for bad tracks:

   Select
      They can simply be selected.
   Delete Track
      The whole track can be deleted.
   Delete Segments
      Bad segments of tracked sequence can be removed.
