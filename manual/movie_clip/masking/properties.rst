Mask Layer

   Mask Layer panel.

Mask Layers
   Mask layers consists of one or several splines and used to "grouped" operation on splines.
   Layers can be used to create complex shapes and to define how the splines interact with each other.
   Splines belonging to the same layer can be animated together, for example by an item
   from motion tracker footage.
   Example of such tools might be parenting the whole set of splines to single motion tracking data or
   simple to transform all of them together.

Opacity
   Used to set the opacity of the mask layer.
Invert (black/white icon)
   Inverts the values (colors) in the mask layer.
Blend
   The layer blending operation to perform. See :term:`Color Blend Modes`.

   Modes *Merge Add* and *Merge Subtract*
   give better results when using a *Feather* on overlapping masks
   than straightforward mathematical addition and subtraction.
Falloff
   Type of the *Feather* falloff, controls the shape of the transition between black and white.
Overlap
   Fills the self-intersecting areas.
Holes
   Overlapping splines from the same layer will generate holes in the mask.

Example
-------

The purpose of mask layers can be explained with an example.
Suppose there are two unwanted people in the footage, and one of them goes from left to right, and
the other in the opposite direction. Two mask layers can then be used to mask them separately by
using a single mask data-block. At the point of intersection of these shapes they will be added together rather than
creating a hole, as would happen if they were on the same layer. If the motion is simple enough,
a single motion tracked point can be used to drive the location of the entire mask layer.


Active Spline
=============

   Active Spline panel.

Feather Offset
   The method used for calculating the offset of the mask spline feather.

   Even
      Preserves the thickness of the feather, but can give undesirable loops of the feather curve.
   Smooth
      Gives a nicer and smoother shape,
      but can also give an undesirable sharp feather when a curve segment forms an S-shape.

Weight Interpolation
   The type of weight (thickness of feather) interpolation between points.
   *Linear* or *Ease* (i.e. changes occur slowly at the beginning and at the end).

Cyclic
   If the spline is closed or not.
Fill
   Creates splines with filled areas.
   If disabled, Blender will create curves with a thickness to mask out thin objects such as wires or hair.
Self Intersection Check
   Prevent the feather (not the curve itself) from intersecting with itself.


Active Point
============

   Active Point panel.

This panel is shown when both a tracking marker and mask is selected.


Parent
------

In the *Movie Clip Editor* it is possible to link the whole mask or its points to motion tracks.
This way the mask or points will follow the tracks.

Make Parent :kbd:`Ctrl-P`
   Parents one or more selected spline points to the active motion tracker.
Clear Parent :kbd:`Alt-P`
   Clears any parenting relationship for the selected spline points.

Parent
   :ref:`Data ID <ui-data-id>` to which the mask or spline is parented to
   in case of parenting to movie tracking data set to Movie Clip data-block.
Type
   Point Track, Plane Track
Object
   :ref:`Object <movie-clip-tracking-properties-object>` to parent to.
Track
   Name of individual tracks.


Mask Settings
=============

Start Frame, End Frame
   Set the frame range of the mask for *Sequencer*.
