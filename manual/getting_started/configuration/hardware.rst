Configuring Peripherals
***********************

Displays
========

A full HD display or higher is recommended.
Multi-monitor setups are supported, and workspaces can be configured to span multiple monitors.

.. figure:: /images/getting-started_configuration_hardware_multi-monitor.jpg

   Example of Blender's multi-monitor support.


Input Devices
=============

Blender supports various types of input devices:

- Keyboard (recommended: keyboard with numeric keypad, English layout works best)
- Mouse (recommended: three button mouse with scroll wheel)
- NDOF Device (also known as *3D Mouse*)
- Graphic Tablet

.. note::

   If you are missing an input device such as a mouse or numpad you can change
   Blender's :doc:`keymap </interface/keymap/blender_default>` to emulate these devices.
   Settings to enable this can be found in the :doc:`Input Preferences </editors/preferences/input>`.


Mouse
-----

Mouse Button Emulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not have a 3 button mouse,
you will need to emulate it by checking the option in the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/input>`.

The following table shows the combinations used:

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - 3-button Mouse
     - :kbd:`LMB`
     - :kbd:`MMB`
     - :kbd:`RMB`
   * - 2-button Mouse
     - :kbd:`LMB`
     - :kbd:`Alt-LMB`
     - :kbd:`RMB`


Keyboard
--------

Numpad Emulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not have a numeric Numpad on the side of your keyboard,
you may want to emulate one (uses the numbers at the top of the keyboard instead,
however, removes quick access to layer visibility).

.. seealso::

   Read more about *Numpad Emulation* in the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/input>`.


Non-English Keyboards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use a keyboard with a non-English keyboard layout, you still may benefit from switching
your computer to the UK or US layout as long as you work with Blender.

.. note::

   You can also change the default keymap and
   default hotkeys from the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/input>`,
   however, this manual assumes you are using the default keymap.


.. _hardware-tablet:

Graphic Tablet
--------------

Graphics tablets can be used to provide a more traditional method of controlling the mouse cursor using a pen.
This can help provide a more familiar experience for artists
who are used to painting and drawing with similar tools,
as well as provide additional controls such as pressure sensitivity.

.. note::

   If you are using a graphic tablet instead of a mouse and pressure sensitivity does not work properly,
   try to place the mouse pointer in the Blender window and then unplug/replug your graphic tablet. This might help.


.. _hardware-ndof:

NDOF (3D Mouse)
---------------

3D mice or :abbr:`NDOF (N-Degrees of Freedom)` devices are hardware that you can use to navigate a scene in Blender.
Currently only devices made by 3Dconnexion are supported.
These devices allow you to explore a scene, as well as making :ref:`Fly/Walk Navigation <3dview-fly-walk>`
easier to control. The NDOF device can be configured in the :ref:`Preference <editors_preferences_input_ndof>`.
These settings can also be accessed using the :kbd:`NDOFMenu` button on the NDOF device
to open a pop-up menu to adjust the settings directly from the viewport.

.. seealso::

   See :doc:`Input Preference </editors/preferences/input>` for more information on configuring peripherals.


.. _hardware-head-mounted-displays:

Head-Mounted Displays (Virtual Reality)
=======================================

:abbr:`HMDs (Head-Mounted Displays)` make it possible to place users in an interactive, virtual environment.
Attached to the head, they track head movements to project a seemingly surrounding world onto small
screens in front of the user's eyes. If the system works well, they experience the virtual environment as
if they were really inside of it.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Virtual reality support in Blender is implemented through the multi-platform OpenXR standard.
This standard is new and therefore support for it is still limited.

.. list-table:: OpenXR compatible platforms.

     - Windows
     - Requires Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903).


Getting Started
---------------

The following subsections describe how an HMD can be set up for usage with the `supported platforms`_.
If this is not done, Blender will report an error when trying to start a virtual reality session.


Oculus
^^^^^^

Oculus provides prototype OpenXR support. To use it, Blender has to be started in a special way, as described below.

- Download and install the `Oculus Rift software <https://www.oculus.com/setup/>`__.
- Start Blender by double clicking the ``blender_oculus`` script inside the installation directory.
  It will open a command-line window with further information.
- Enable the :doc:`VR Scene Inspection add-on </addons/3d_view/vr_scene_inspection>` in Blender.


SteamVR
^^^^^^^

OpenXR support in SteamVR is a developer preview. It requires SteamVR beta features.

- `Enable SteamVR beta updates <https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/optin-to-steamvr-beta.html>`__.
- Launch SteamVR. It should show a prompt for making SteamVR the default OpenXR runtime. Click ``Set as default``.
- Enable the :doc:`VR Scene Inspection add-on </addons/3d_view/vr_scene_inspection>` in Blender.


Windows Mixed Reality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check if a PC meets the requirements to run Windows Mixed Reality, Microsoft offers
the `Windows Mixed Reality PC Check <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-mixed-reality-pc-check/9nzvl19n7cnc>`__
application.

- Make sure the Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903) is installed.
- If the system meets all requirements, the Mixed Reality Portal should already be installed.
  It is also available in
  the `Microsoft Store <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mixed-reality-portal/9ng1h8b3zc7m>`__.
- Launch the Mixed Reality Portal. Click the menu button ``...`` in the lower left corner.
  In the menu it opens, select the *Set up OpenXR*.
- Enable the :doc:`VR Scene Inspection add-on </addons/3d_view/vr_scene_inspection>` in Blender.

For more information, refer to Windows' `Getting Started Guide for OpenXR
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/native/openxr-getting-started>`__.


Monado
^^^^^^

Monado is a :doc:`free and open source </getting_started/about/license>` XR platform for Linux.
It is not yet ready for production usage and should only be used for testing purposes.

Packages are available for the following distributions:

- Ubuntu (`Eoan, Focal <https://launchpad.net/~monado-xr/+archive/ubuntu/monado>`__)
- Debian (`bullseye <https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libopenxr1-monado>`__,
  `sid <https://packages.debian.org/sid/libopenxr1-monado>`__)

For other systems, it has to be compiled from source, which in this case is not
recommended for people with little experience in compiling software.
Follow the `Getting Started Guides <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/blob/master/README.md>`__
from Monado to do so nevertheless.
