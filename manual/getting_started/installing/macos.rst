Installing on macOS
*******************

Check the :doc:`Downloading Blender </getting_started/installing/index>`
page to find the minimum requirements and where to get Blender (if you have not done so yet).


Install from DMG
================

Blender for macOS are distributed on disk images (dmg-files).
To mount the disk image double-click on the dmg-file.
Then drag ``Blender.app`` into the Applications folder.

Depending on the Security and Privacy preferences of your Mac,
before opening Blender for the first time, macOS will request your approval.

.. tip:: How to Make a Portable Installation

   To keep all configuration files and installed add-ons inside the Blender application bundle,
   create a folder named ``config`` in the :ref:`LOCAL directory <blender-directory-layout>`.

   .. parsed-literal:: ./Blender.app/Contents/Resources/|BLENDER_VERSION|/config/


Updating on macOS
=================

On macOS there are various ways of updating Blender. This section covers the most common approach.


Updating with DMG
-----------------

When an update for Blender is released, it can be downloaded directly
from the `Blender website <https://www.blender.org/download/>`__.
Install the new version by overwriting the current ``Blender.app`` in the Applications folder.
You can rename ``Blender.app`` or place it in a different folder to have more than one version at a time.

   The Splash screen :doc:`/getting_started/configuration/defaults` page for information
   about import settings from previous Blender versions and on other quick settings.
