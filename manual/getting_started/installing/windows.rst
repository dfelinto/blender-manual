Installing on Windows
*********************

Check the :doc:`Downloading Blender </getting_started/installing/index>`
page to find the minimum requirements and where to get Blender (if you have not done so yet).

Download the zip-file or Windows Installer File.


Install from Windows Installer File
===================================

The Windows installer when run will let you choose where to place Blender
and configure Windows to have an entry to the start menu and to open blend-files with Blender.
Administrator rights are needed to install Blender on your system.


Install from Zip
================

When choosing the zip-file you have to manually extract Blender to the desired folder,
where you can double-click the executable to run Blender.

There is no installer to place Blender on the menu, but there is also no need for administrator rights.
With this option, it is possible to have multiple versions of Blender without conflicting,
as they are not actually installed on the system.

However, if you want a particular version to be registered with your computer the simply run ``blender -r``
from the :doc:`Command Line </advanced/command_line/arguments>`.

.. tip:: How to Make a Portable Installation

   To keep all configuration files and installed add-ons in the executable folder,
   create a folder named ``config`` in the :ref:`LOCAL directory <blender-directory-layout>`
   of the unzipped folder.


Install from Microsoft Store
============================

Blender can be installed from the Microsoft Store by searching for Blender in the Microsoft Store
and installing it.

Blender can now be launched from the Windows Start menu.
