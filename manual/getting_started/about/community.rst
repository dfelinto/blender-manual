The Blender Community
*********************

Being freely available from the start, even while it was closed source,
considerably helped Blender's adoption by the community.
A large, stable, and active community of users has gathered around Blender since 1998.
The community showed its support for Blender in 2002 when they helped raise
â‚¬100,000 in seven weeks to enable Blender to go Open Source under
the `GNU GPL License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`__.


Independent Sites
=================

There are `several independent websites <https://www.blender.org/community/>`__
such as forums, blogs, news, and tutorial sites dedicated to Blender.

One of the largest community forums is `Blender Artists <https://blenderartists.org/>`__,
where Blender users gather to show off their creations,
get feedback, ask and offer help and, in general, discuss Blender.


Getting Support
===============

Blender's community is one of its greatest features, so apart from this user manual,
there are many different ways to get support from other users, such as :ref:`blender-chat`,
`Stack Exchange <https://blender.stackexchange.com/>`__, and `Reddit <https://reddit.com/r/blender/>`__.

For studios and organizations there is `Enterprise support <https://www.blender.org/support/>`__,
and for studios looking to add Blender to their pipeline, `Blender Studio <https://studio.blender.org/>`__
contains documentation and training material around this topic.
If you think you have found an issue with Blender, please
`report a bug <https://developer.blender.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/>`__.

More details about support can be found on the `support page <https://www.blender.org/support/>`__.


Development
===========

Being open source, Blender welcomes development from volunteers.
Communication between developers is done mostly through three platforms:

- The `developer.blender.org <https://developer.blender.org/>`__ system
- Various `mailing lists <https://lists.blender.org/mailman/listinfo>`__
- Online Chat (see below)

If you are interested in helping develop Blender,
see the `Get Involved <https://www.blender.org/get-involved/>`__ page.
