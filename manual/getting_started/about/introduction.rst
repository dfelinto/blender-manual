Welcome to Blender! Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite.

With Blender, you can create 3D visualizations such as
still images, 3D animations and VFX shots. You can also edit videos.
It is well suited to individuals and small studios who
benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.

Being a cross-platform application, Blender runs on Linux, macOS, as well as Windows systems.
It also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites.
Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.

Blender makes it possible to perform a wide range of tasks, and it may seem daunting
when first trying to grasp the basics. However, with a bit of motivation and the right learning material,
it is possible to familiarize yourself with Blender after a few hours of practice.

This manual is a good start, though it serves more as a reference.
There are also many online video tutorials from specialized websites.

Despite everything Blender can do, it remains a tool. Great artists do not create masterpieces
by pressing buttons or manipulating brushes, but by learning and practicing subjects
such as human anatomy, composition, lighting, animation principles, etc.

3D creation software such as Blender have an added technical complexity and
jargon associated with the underlying technologies.
Terms like UV maps, materials, shaders, meshes, and "subdivs" are the media of the digital artist,
and understanding them, even broadly, will help you to use Blender to its best.

So keep reading this manual, learn the great tool that Blender is, and keep your mind open to
other artistic and technological areas -- and you, too, can become a great artist.
