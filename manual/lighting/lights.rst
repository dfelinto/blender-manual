Lights
******

As previously stated, there are multiple types of lighting in Blender, like indirect light or ambient light. However, one of the most used are "lights", or "lamps". In this section, we will discuss general info and settings for these lights (you will find more lamp-specific details in the :doc:`Lamps </lighting/lamps>` section):


- :doc:`Light Properties </lighting/lights/light_properties>` - settings common to all lamps.
- :doc:`Light Attenuation </lighting/lights/light_attenuation>`.
- :doc:`Textures </lighting/lights/textures>` - how to apply texture(s) to lamps.
- :doc:`What Light Affects </lighting/lights/what_light_affects>`.
- :doc:`Lights In Other Contexts </lighting/lights/lights_in_other_contexts>` - lamp-related setting in other contexts.
