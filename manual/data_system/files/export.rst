Exporting Files
***************

Its not always that you will have to work on a project using one software. Basically,
you might start off in Blender,
but you will want to switch to another software and continue from there.

That is possible as Blender allows *Exporting* to other formats.
Blender 2.65 currently supports exporting to 8 formats, including COLLADA.

These are important so that you can share you files with others who are not Blender users,
such as those using Autodesk® 3DS Max®.
