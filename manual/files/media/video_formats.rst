Supported Video & Audio Formats

Video Formats
=============

These formats are primarily used for compressing rendered sequences into a playable movie
(they can also be used to make plain audio files).

A codec is a little routine that compresses the video so that it will fit on a Blu-ray,
or be able to be streamed out over the Internet, over a cable, or just be a reasonable file size.
Codecs compress the channels of a video down to save space and enable continuous playback.
*Lossy* codecs make smaller files at the expense of image quality,
while *lossless* codecs compress as much as possible the video, but without losing any existing data.

Some codecs, like H.264, are great for larger images. Codecs are used to encode and decode the movie,
and so must be present on both the encoding machine (Blender) and the target machine.
The results of the encoding are stored in a container file.

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of codecs, including Xvid, H.264, DivX, Microsoft,
and so on. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and compatibility with different players on
different operating systems.

.. note::

   Most codecs can only compress the RGB or YUV colors,
   but some support the Alpha channel as well. Codecs that support RGBA include:

   - `FFmpeg video codec #1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFV1>`__
   - `PNG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics>`__
   - Quicktime
   - PNG TIFF Pixlet is not lossless, and may be only available on macOS.
   - WebM/VP9 (although Blender will not import the alpha channel due to
     a `limitation of FFmpeg <https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/8344>`__).

Blender offers three ways to export videos, in the *File Format* selector of the *Output* properties:

AVI JPEG
   AVI but with JPEG compression.
   Lossy, smaller files but not as small as you can get with a Codec compression algorithm.
   JPEG compression is also the one used in the DV format used in digital camcorders.
AVI Raw
   Audio-Video Interlaced (AVI) uncompressed frames.
FFmpeg Video
   Video encoding via the FFmpeg library. Which codecs are available
   depends on the operating system and FFmpeg version. This options allows
   for a lot of different encodings, some presets are available
   (to the right of the *Encoding* subpanel) to help with getting started.
   This option is also the only one allowing to export audio.

FFmpeg Containers
=================

`MPEG-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1>`__: ``.mpg``, ``.mpeg``
   A standard for lossy compression of video and audio.
   It is designed to compress VHS-quality raw digital video and CD audio down to 1.5 Mbit/s.
   This container enforces the video codec, you can only define quality parameters, and the audio codec.
`MPEG-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2>`__: ``.dvd``, ``.vob``, ``.mpg``, ``.mpeg``
   A standard for "the generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information".
   It describes a combination of lossy video compression and lossy audio data compression
   methods which permit storage and transmission of movies using
   currently available storage media (notably DVDs) and transmission bandwidth.
   This container enforces the video codec, you can only define quality parameters, and the audio codec.
`MPEG-4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4>`__: ``.mp4``, ``.mpg``, ``.mpeg``
   While being a :ref:`video codec <files-video-codecs>`, it is also a real container,
   in which you can store video and audio streams using various codecs.
   It is widely supported by many modern software and hardware players.
`AVI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave>`__: ``.avi``
   A derivative of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF).
   One of the first and most widely used video container format.
`Quicktime <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mov>`__: ``.mov``
   A multi-tracks format. QuickTime and MP4 container formats can use the same codecs.
   They are mostly interchangeable in a QuickTime-only environment.
   MP4, being an international standard, has more support.
`DV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV>`__: ``.dv``
   An intra-frame video compression scheme, used by many digital camcorders back in the days.
   It uses the discrete cosine transform (DCT, similar algorithm to JPEG)
   to compress video on a frame-by-frame basis.
   Audio is stored uncompressed.
   This container enforces the video codec, you can only define quality parameters.
`Ogg <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg>`__: ``.ogg``, ``.ogv``
   A free open-standard container format, that can hold an unlimited number of video,
   audio, picture or subtitle tracks in one file.
`Matroska <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska>`__: ``.mkv``
   A free open-standard container format, a file format that can hold an unlimited number of video,
   audio, picture or subtitle tracks in one file.
`Flash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video>`__: ``.flv``
   A container file format used to deliver video over the Internet using Adobe Flash Player.
   This container enforces the video codec, you can only define quality parameters.
`WebM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM>`__: ``.webm``
   A free open-standard container format, designed to be used for internet streaming.
   Note that this container can only hold a VP9 video codec, and Vorbis or Opus audio codecs.

   and as a presentation format. It can be either lossless or lossy.
`DV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV>`__
   See :ref:`Containers <files-video-containers>`.
`FFmpeg video codec #1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFV1>`__
   FFV1 is a lossless intra-frame video codec.
   It can use either variable length coding or arithmetic coding for entropy coding.
   The encoder and decoder are part of the free, open-source library libavcodec in FFmpeg.
   Supports an alpha channel.
`Flash Video <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video>`__
   See :ref:`Containers <files-video-containers>`.

   A modern variation of the MPEG-4 family, this lossy codec is very commonly used.
   It offers a very good compression/quality ratio.
`HuffYUV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffyuv>`__
   Lossless video codec created by Ben Rudiak-Gould which is

Known Limitations
=================

Video Output Size
-----------------

Some codecs impose limitations on output size,
``H.264``, for example requires both the height and width to be divisible by 2.
