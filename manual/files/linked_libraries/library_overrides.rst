Library Overrides
*****************

Library Overrides is a system designed to allow editing
:doc:`linked data </files/linked_libraries/link_append>`, while keeping it in sync
with the original library data. Most types of linked data-blocks can be overridden,
and the properties of these overrides can then be edited. When the library data changes,
unmodified properties of the overridden one will be updated accordingly.

.. note::

   The old proxy system has been deprecated in Blender 3.0, and fully removed in Blender 3.2.
   Automatic conversion from proxies to library overrides happens when loading a blend-file,
   but results on complex characters are not guaranteed and may need manual fixes.

Library overrides supports:

- Multiple independent overrides of a same linked data
  (e.g. having the same character multiple times in the same scene).
- Adding new modifiers and constraints, anywhere in the stack.
- Recursively chaining overrides (i.e. link and override overrides from another library file, etc.).

.. - Overriding many more types of data-blocks, and selectively edit some of their properties
   (e.g. materials, textures...).

.. note::

   There are known issues that have to be addressed. See Phabricator `main task of the project
   <https://developer.blender.org/T73318>`__, for more details.

.. warning::

   While in most cases library overrides data is preserved accross a loss of reference linked data
   (if e.g. the library file becomes unavailable or is relocated), there are some exceptions.

   The main one is probably posed (but not animated) armature objects, when their Aramture obdata
   itself is not overridden. The Pose bones of an armature object are fully linked to the bones
   of its Armature obdata, if the later goes missing, the pose bones are definitively lost.


.. note:: Proper Collections Layout Matters

   For library overrides to work well, it is much better if **all** the collections needed by
   the character are children of the root (linked and instantiated) one, such that there is a
   clear hierarchy.
   Otherwise, some data may not be properly automatically overridden, and other operations
   may be less reliable.


Override Hierarchies
====================

Hierarchy is a very important concept to understand when working with library overrides.
In Blender, a real-life asset (a character, a prop, a set, etc.) is almost never made of a
single data-block, but is rather a group of data-blocks with dependency relationships to each-other.
E.g. a character will typically have an armature object, several geometry objects,
rig-controllers objects, the object data for all of these objects, materials, textures, etc.

These relationships can be represented as a tree, with a root data-block 'linking-in' all its
dependencies, recursively. With library overrides, typically, the root of the hierarchy is also
the data-block that is directly linked when importing the asset (usually a collection).

This concept of hierarchy can also be seen as some sort of super meta-data-block. It is critical
when there are several overrides of the same linked data, since it allows to clearly identify a given
data-block to one override, leaving no ambiguity to processes that affect the whole hierarchy
(e.g. resyncing overrides with their linked data). It also allows to share relationships between
data-blocks of different hierarchies, like a parenting relationships between two different overrides
of a same character.


Resyncing Overrides
===================

The relationships between linked data-blocks can change, resulting in outdated overrides.
When this happens, overrides need to be resynced to match the new structure of their hierarchy.
Overrides are automatically resynced if needed on blend-files opening. However,
it may be needed to resynced them manually sometimes, see `Troubleshoot an Override Hierarchy`_.

.. tip::

   Blender is also able to resync library overrides from external libraries, that are then linked into a
   working file. However, this is a costly process that needs to be fully redone every time the working
   file is loaded, since Blender cannot edit/modify the external library directly.

   So users linking overrides (or creating recursive overrides) should ensure that their library files are
   regularly updated, to avoid this overhead on file load (typically, opening and saving those library files
   should be enough to update them).

.. tip::

   Auto resyncing can be disabled in the :doc:`Experimental Preferences </editors/preferences/experimental>`.


Non-Editable Overrides
======================

For technical reasons (how relationships between data-blocks are stored), Blender needs to create
overrides of a lot of data-blocks, even when only one or two of them actually needs to be edited
by the user. To reduce the amount of information and risk of potential unwanted editing, most of
these data-blocks are now marked as non-editable by default. This can be changed once the
override has been created.

Make an Override
================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    3D Viewport, Outliner, Properties
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Header --> Object --> Library Override --> Make`
               :menuselection:`Outliner --> Context Menu --> Library Override --> Make`
               :menuselection:`ID Widget --> Context Menu --> Library Override --> Make`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-LMB` on the 'linked'/'overridden' button of an ID Widget.

Create overrides from the selected data-blocks.

Blender automatically create overrides for all required data-blocks to ensure that
valid override hierarchies are created.

Only overrides created from selected items will be user-editable. 

.. warning::

   The support for the creation of library overrides from the ID Widget (mainly from within
   the *Properties* editor) is limited. While the most common usages should be supported,
   especially with Objects, meshes, etc., much remains to be implemented.


Selected Items
--------------

Depending on where from the override is created, there are several ways to
'select' items to be overridden and user-editable.

.. note::

   This also applies to the other common operations (*Reset* and *Clear*).

   The *Troubleshoot* advanced operations only available from the Outliner
   always apply to a whole override hierarchy.

3DView
______

The selected objects will be considered as selected.

When a selected object is a local *Empty* instantiating a linked collection,
the following will happen:
* The *Empty* object will be removed.
* Its linked collection will be overridden, and that override will be instanced
in the same collection in the current *View Layer*.
* If the collection contains *Armature* objects, they will be user-editable.
Otherwise, no created override will be defined as user-editable.

Outliner
________

The operation can be applied on either the selected items only, their content only, or both.

.. tip::

   Using *Selected & Content* is an easy way to get all newly created overrides immediately
   user-editable.


ID Widget
_________

Only the linked data-block in the ID Widget is considered as selected, and set as editable
once overridden.


Make Editable
-------------

That same operation can also be used to make existing overrides user-editable,
after they have been created, or :ref:`cleared<Clear Override>`


.. _bpy.ops.object.reset_override_library:
.. _bpy.ops.ui.override_idtemplate_reset:

Reset an Override
=================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    3D Viewport, Outliner, Properties
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Header --> Object --> Library Override --> Reset`
               :menuselection:`Outliner --> Context Menu --> Library Override --> Reset`
               :menuselection:`ID Widget --> Context Menu --> Library Override --> Reset`

Reset the selected overrides to their original values (from the linked reference data).
Unlike with the *Clear* operation, the overrides remain fully editable, and are never deleted.


.. _bpy.ops.object.clear_override_library:
.. _bpy.ops.ui.override_idtemplate_clear:
.. _Clear Override:

Clear an Override
=================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    3D Viewport, Outliner, Properties
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Header --> Object --> Library Override --> Clear`
               :menuselection:`Outliner --> Context Menu --> Library Override --> Clear`
               :menuselection:`ID Widget --> Context Menu --> Library Override --> Clear`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-LMB` on the 'overridden' button of an ID Widget.

Reset the selected overrides to their original values, and if possible without breaking the
existing hierarchy, delete them and replace them by their linked reference data.
Otherwise, keep the overrides but mark them as non-editable.


Edit an Override
================

Essentially, an override is edited the same way as a regular local data-block.
You can use operators on them, edit their properties from various editors, etc.
There are some limitations however, most notably Edit Mode is not allowed for overrides.
In most cases, as soon as you edit a property, you can see that it's overridden by its teal blue
outline/background.

You can also animate overrides, animated properties just replace/supersede overrides then.
Note that you cannot override/edit an existing animation, you'll have to create a new action.
You can manually define or remove an override from the context menu of the relevant property.
If an override is not editable, you have to make it editable first.

Define Overrides
----------------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Any
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Property:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Define Overrides`
               :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Define Override`

Mark a property to be overridden in the local blend file. For array properties
all elements will be overridden.


Define Single Override
----------------------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Any
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Property:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Define Single Override`

Mark a property to be overridden in the local blend file. For array properties only
the selected element will be overridden.


.. _bpy.ops.ui.remove_override_button:

Remove Overrides
----------------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Any
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Property:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Remove Overrides`
               :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Remove Override`

Remove the property from the overrides. The value of the linked in data-block will be used.
For array properties all elements will be removed from the override.


Remove Single Override
----------------------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Any
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Property:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Remove Single Override`

Remove the property from the overrides. The value of the linked in data-block will be used.
For array properties only the selected elements will be removed from the override.


.. _TroubleshootOverride:
.. _bpy.ops.outliner.liboverride_troubleshoot_operation:

Troubleshoot an Override Hierarchy
==================================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Outliner
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Outliner:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Library override --> Troubleshoot`

These operations are only available from the Outliner contextual menu. They can help fixing a broken
override hierarchy.

Resync
------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Outliner
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Outliner:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Library override --> Troubleshoot --> Resync`

The hierarchy of the linked data (the relationships between linked data-blocks) can change.
Overrides need to be resynced to match the new hierarchy. This operator will resync the override
to match the new hierarchy in the library.

.. warning::

   While resyncing a library override it is possible that edited overrides
   get deleted if they are changed in the original library.
   If this is the case, a warning message will be displayed stating how many overrides were deleted,
   if the deletion is undesirable the resync can be undone before saving the blend-file.

.. note:: This Process is Automatic

   Usually, this operation happens automatically when blender detects it is needed, on file load, unless
   it is disabled in the :doc:`Experimental Preferences </editors/preferences/experimental>`.


Resync Enforce
--------------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Outliner
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Outliner:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Library override --> Troubleshoot --> Resync Enforce`

In some cases, especially with older blend-files that were saved with 'broken' (non-hierarchy-matching) overrides,
a regular resync itself cannot rebuild properly the override as expected (e.g. some objects might go missing).
To solve this issue, this operator rebuilds the local override from its linked reference,
as well as its hierarchy of dependencies, enforcing that hierarchy to match the linked data
(i.e. ignoring existing overrides on data-blocks properties).
This is similar to a regular resync, but is more forceful, aggressive,
at the cost of a potential loss of some overrides on ID pointers properties.


Delete
------

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Outliner
   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Outliner:  :menuselection:`Context Menu --> Library override --> Troubleshoot --> Delete`

Remove the whole library override hierarchy, and replace all of these override data-blocks by
their original linked data-blocks. This fully reverts the *Make* operation.
