Proxies
*******

Proxies were the historical way in Blender to allow some local editing of linked data-blocks.
This was mostly aimed at character animation.

They are now fully deprecated as of Blender 3.0, replaced by the new
:doc:`Library Overrides </files/linked_libraries/library_overrides>`.

Existing proxies in older blend-files will be converted to library overrides when
opening it in Blender 3.2.
