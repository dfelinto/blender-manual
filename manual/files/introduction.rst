Introduction
************

Each blend-file contains a database.
This database contains all scenes, objects, meshes, textures, etc. that are in the file.

A file can contain multiple :doc:`Scenes </scene_layout/scene/introduction>`
and each scene can contain multiple :doc:`Objects </scene_layout/object/introduction>`.
Objects can contain multiple materials which can contain many textures.
It is also possible to create links between different objects, or share data between objects.
A file can link data from other Blender files.


Outliner
========

You can easily inspect the contents of your file by using the *Outliner* editor,
which displays all of the data in your blend-file.

The *Outliner* allows you to do simple operations on objects,
such as selecting, renaming, deleting, linking and parenting.
