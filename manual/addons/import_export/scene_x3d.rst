Usage
=====

TODO.


Properties
==========

Import
------

Transform
^^^^^^^^^

Forward / Up Axis
   Since many applications use a different axis for 'Up', these are axis conversions for
   Forward and Up axes -- By mapping these to different axes you can convert rotations
   between applications default up and forward axes.

   Blender uses Y forward, Z up (since the front view looks along the +Y direction).
   For example, its common for applications to use Y as the up axis, in that case -Z forward, Y up is needed.
