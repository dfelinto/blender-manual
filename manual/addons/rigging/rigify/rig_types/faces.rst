``faces.super_face``
====================

Will create a face system based on the bones child to the parent that has the property set on it.

Requirement: All the face bones bundled in the ``faces.super_face`` sample had to be present and
child of the master bone that has the Rigify-type *face* property set.

.. note::

   This rig type is being deprecated in favor of a new modular :doc:`skin <skin>` and :doc:`face <face>` rigging system.
