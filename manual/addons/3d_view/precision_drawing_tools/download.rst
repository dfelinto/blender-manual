.. container:: lead

   .. clear
Only one PDT menu (Design) is shown as expanded, by default all menus are expanded when the add-on is loaded.

Optional Button Labels, Messages, Descriptions, etc.
====================================================

All Button labels, Input Descriptions & Messages in PDT are stored in the file: ``pdt_msg_strings.py`` You may edit this file to reflect any changes you want in button names, etc. but only edit the portion in quotes, do not add any new lines, or delete any lines and do not change any of the ``PDT_`` assignments at the start of each line, for some options, alternatives have been suggested as shown below:

.. figure:: /images/addons_pdt_msg_edit.png
   :align: left
   :width: 620px

.. container:: lead

   .. clear
It is recommended that you save a backup of this file in a safe location on your computer before performing any edits.

You might also like to translate these into your own language, again only edit the message section in quotes, not the PDT assignments.

Issues
======

Please report any issues, or feature request, etc. using the Issues section of the PDT Repository (https://github.com/Clockmender/Precision-Drawing-Tools/issues), that way they can be properly tracked, actioned and incorporated into the add-on.
