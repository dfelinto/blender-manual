including architectural projects, technical design and 3D printing.

- Mesh vertex to vertex measure: Length between vertices in the same mesh.
- Mesh vertex labeling: Add a label to any mesh vertex.
  This allows identify easily different areas or objects in the scene.
- Object to object: Distance between object origins, vertex to origin or vertex to vertex.
- Object to origin: Distance between object origin to scene origin or vertex to scene origin.
- Allows work with different scales.
- The measures can be used with meshes, empties, lights, and cameras.
