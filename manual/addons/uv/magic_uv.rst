   :Menu:      :menuselection:`UV --> Copy/Paste UV`
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Magic UV --> Copy/Paste UV --> Copy/Paste UV`

Copy and paste UV coordinates among same/different object's faces in 3D View.
Copy/Paste UV sometimes fails to paste UV correctly because of the incorrect UV index.
Instead, you can try Transfer UV which you can copy and paste based on the topology.

Target UV Map
  :Default: Copy/paste UV maps currently displayed.
  :All: Copy/Paste all UV maps.
  :New: Allocate new UV map and paste to it.

Copy/Paste Mode
   :Selection Sequence: provides a way to specify the ordering of copied/pasted faces by face selection.
Seams
   If enabled, you can also copy/paste seams.
Strategy
   Provides a way to decide copy/paste UV repeatedly if a number of copied faces is differs from pasted faces.

.. tip::

   You can flip or rotate UV by changing *Flip Copied UV* property or *Rotate Copied UV* property.

.. rubric:: Usage

#. Click check box *Copy/Paste UV* to show Copy/Paste UV menu.
#. Select faces whose UV you want to copy.
