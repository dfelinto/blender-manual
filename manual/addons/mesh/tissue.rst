Tissue is a collection of tools that facilitate the use of computational-design techniques inside Blender.
It consists of different tools, visible in the right panel. According to the active mode, different tools are displayed:

- :ref:`Tissue Tools <tissue tools>` (visible in Edit Mode and Object Mode)
- :ref:`Tissue Weight Tools <tissue weight tools>`  (visible in Weight Paint Mode)
- :ref:`Tissue Color Tools <tissue color tools>`  (visible in Vertex Weight Mode)


Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Mesh then Tissue to enable the script.

Tissue Tools
===========

.. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tissue-tools.jpg

Generators
----------

*Generators* are non-destructive functions that generate new objects starting
from input objects. They include **Tessellate**, **Dual Mesh** (a special
Tessellate) and **Convert to Curve**. For all of them, a **Refresh** operator can be used in order to reload the
changes from the input objects.

Tessellate
----------

The *Tessellate* tool allows the user to copy a selected object (Component) on the faces of
the active object (Base), adapting its bounding box to the shape of quad faces.
It is possible to use as input objects *Mesh*, *Curve*, *Surface* and *Text* and *Meta* objects.
When using Tessellate, two objects must be selected.
Once the *Tessellate* button was pressed, then more options will appear in the tool parameters.

.. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-operator.jpg

Later it will be possible to change them, together with more advanced settings from the *Object Data Panel* of the generated object.

.. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-panel.jpg

Use Modifiers
   This option is available for both *Base* and *Component* objects and allows the use
   the respective modifiers. If this option is disabled, then only the original object's
   data will be used.

Fill Mode
  Tessellation strategy used to map the Component's coordinates on the Base's faces.

  .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-fill-modes.jpg

  Tri
    This options will automatically triangulate the Base object and will map the component
    to the triangular faces. The input domain will be considered rectangular, but the
    target domain will have two vertices coincident.
  Quad (default)
    This is the default method and will map the Component domain to each quad face of the Base object.
    If an face has more than 4 vertices, then it will be automatically separated in quad or triangular faces.

    .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-quad-mode.jpg

  Fan
    This option will split every face of the Base object in triangles connecting each side of the face
    to its center.

    .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-fan-mode.jpg

  Patch
    This option require the use of a Subdivision Surface modifier on the Base object.
    It is similar to the *Quad* method, but it will allow to use curved domains, based on the Subdivided patches.
    If more subdivision surfaces (or Multiresolution modifiers) are used, then only the last one will be used for
    defining the target patches.

    .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-patch-mode.jpg

  Frame
    Similarly to an Inset Face operator, this option will allow to apply the components along
    offset faces of a given Thickness.

    .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-frame-mode.jpg


Merge
  Automatically merge together all the generated components.

Smooth Shading
  Automatically sets the shading of the generated geometry as Smooth. If the Component
  object is already set as Smooth, then this option is not necessary.

Thickness
  Scale Mode
    Constant
      Generate components with a fixed and uniform thickness in the normal direction.
    Relative
      Generate components with a thickness proportional to the target face dimension.
      This will produce components with an aspect ration similar to the original Component
      object.
    Scale
      control the scaling factor of the components' Thickness
    Offset
      Allows to control the alignment of the components in relation to the Base object surface.

Weight and Morphing
  Combine the Vertex Groups of the base object with the Shape Keys from the component, in order to generate morphing components.

  .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-weight-and-morphing.jpg

  Map Vertex Groups
    Remap each Vertex Group from the base mesh to the generated geometry

  Use Shape Keys
    Transfer the Shape Keys from the component object to the generated object.
    If the name of the base's vertex groups and the Shape Keys match, then they
    will be automatically assigned in order to control their morphing behavior.

Iterations
  Automatically repeat the tessellation using as base the result of the previous iteration.

  .. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_tessellate-iterations.jpg

  Repeat
    Number of iterations.

  Combine iterations
    Combine the resulting tessellation with part or all of the previous iteration:

      Last
        Ignore the previous iterations.

      Unused
        Combine the tessellation with the faces of the previous iteration that are not generating components.

      All
        Combine the tessellation with all the faces from the previous iteration.

Dual Mesh
----------

*Dual Mesh* modifies the selected meshes creating dual meshes.
Dual Mesh output is a polygonal mesh derived from the triangular mesh.
Quadrangular meshes are automatically converted to triangular before.

.. figure:: /images/addons_mesh_tissue_dual-mesh.jpg

Quad Method
   Methods for splitting the quads into triangles. (Inherited from the *Triangulate Faces* tool.)
Polygon Method
   Methods for splitting the polygons into triangles. (Inherited from the *Triangulate Faces* tool.)
Preserve Borders
   Prevent alteration of the open boundaries of the mesh.
