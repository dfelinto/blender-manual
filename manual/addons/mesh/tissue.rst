The add-on is composed by different tools for computational design.


Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Mesh then Tissue to enable the script.


Description
===========

Tessellate
----------

The *Tessellate* tool allows the user to copy a selected object (Component) on the faces of
the active object (Generator), adapting its bounding box to the shape of quad faces.
Once the *Tessellate* button was pressed, then more options will appear in the tool parameters.
Update allows you to update the active the Tessellated mesh according to Component and Generator changes.
You can also change the parameters of tessellation.

New Object Name
   Specify the name of the new object generated by the Tessellate tool.

Generator:
   Fill Mode
      Allows to chose the filling method.

      Quad
         For quadrangular meshes *Quad* option is preferable.
      Fan
         While for polygonal meshes *Fan* works better.
   Merge
      Removes duplicated vertices according to threshold value.
   Randomize
      Create a random of the components according to seed.

Component:
   Component XY
      Allows to chose how the component object is parametrized.

      Adaptive
         Automatically calculate the Bounding Box of the object.
      Constant
         For more control chose *Constant*, that consider a domain in which X and Y go from 0.0 to 1.0.
   Component Z
      Allows to chose how the thickness is calculated.

      Constant
         Uses the Z of the component.
      Proportional
         Using *Proportional* the Z of generated components changes according to generator faces area.

         .. warning::

            Using *Proportional* can create some openings if used with *Merge* options.
   Scale
      Allows to change thickness of the generated mesh.
   Offset
      Allows to offset the thickness from the center.


Update
------

The options for the *Update* tool are the same of *Tessellate*.
Furthermore, it allows to change Generator object and Component object.


Colors-Weight Exchanger
-----------------------

The Colors-Weight Exchanger consists of two tools: *Colors from Weight* and *Weight from Colors*
that allow the user to convert the active vertex color to vertex group and vice versa.


Colors from Weight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Convert To
   Value Channel, Red Channel, Green Channel, Blue Channel, False Color
Invert
   Invert the values read from vertex weight.


Weight from Colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Red Channel
   Add a vertex group derived to red channel of the active vertex color.
Green Channel
   Add a vertex group derived to green channel of the active vertex color.
Blue Channel
   Add a vertex group derived to blue channel of the active vertex color.
Value Channel
   Add a vertex group derived to value channel of the active vertex color.
Invert
   Invert the values read from vertex weight.


Dual Mesh
---------

*Dual Mesh* modifies the selected meshes creating dual meshes.
Dual Mesh output is a polygonal mesh derived from the triangular mesh.
Quadrangular meshes are automatically converted to triangular before.

Quad Method
   Methods for splitting the quads into triangles. (Inherited from the *Triangulate Faces* tool.)
Polygon Method
   Methods for splitting the polygons into triangles. (Inherited from the *Triangulate Faces* tool.)
Preserve Borders
   Prevent alteration of the open boundaries of the mesh.
