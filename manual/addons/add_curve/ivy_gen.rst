Ivy Gen

his original `IvyGen program <http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/~luft/ivy_generator/>`__.

Original Blender port by testscreenings, further advances by PKHG and TrumanBlending.

- Click Add Curve then Ivy Gen to enable the script.


Interface
=========

.. figure:: /images/addons_add-curve_ivy-gen_ui.jpg
   :align: right
   :width: 220px

Located in the :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Sidebar --> Create tab`.

Located in the :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Operator`.

The Update Ivy operator is separate from the main menu and appears in the 3D Viewport.
You can adjust settings in the panel and press the *Update* button to update parameters.


Instructions
============

#. Select the object you want to grow ivy on.
#. Enter Edit Mode and select a vertex that you want the ivy to spawn from.
#. Snap the cursor to the selected vertex.
#. Enter Object Mode and with the object selected:
   :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Create --> Ivy Generator panel` adjust settings and choose *Add New Ivy*.

The *Add Default Ivy* operator will use the default parameters during creation.
This will generate your initial Ivy Curve and Leaves.
From here you can access the *Ivy* menu in the Sidebar.
I suggest to make small changes and then press *Update Ivy* in the 3D Viewport operator.
