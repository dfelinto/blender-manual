Collection Manager
******************

This add-on adds new functionality for the management of collections via a pop-up
and a QCD (Quick Content Display) system in the 3D Viewport. It also offers simple display
and modification of the relationship of objects with collections.

Description
===========

Pop-up
------

Use :kbd:`M` to call up the main Collection Manager pop-up in the 3D Viewport when in Object Mode.
It can also be found in the :menuselection:`Object --> Collection` menu.

View Layer
   Render
      Enable/disable rendering of this view layer with this checkbox.
   View Layer
      :ref:`ui-data-block` of the current view layer.

Expand All Items
   Toggle all collections expanded or collapsed. Only enabled when you have subcollections.

Renumber QCD Slots
   Shown only if QCD is enabled in the preferences.

   - :kbd:`LMB` -- Renumber the QCD slots from the root slot (the slot designated 1)
     down to the bottom, for each depth level
     (`breadth first search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>`__).
   - :kbd:`Alt-LMB` -- Renumber from the first top-level collection in
     a `breadth first search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>`__ pattern.
   - :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` -- Switch the renumber pattern to linear.
     This pattern will renumber straight down the list regardless of hierarchy.
   - :kbd:`Shift-LMB` -- Constrain renumbering to the branch under the root slot.

   Filtering
      By Name
         A text field to filter collections by name.

      Invert (magnifying glass icon)

         shown is hidden and what was hidden is shown).

      By Selected (box icon)
         Filter collections by selected objects (show only collections that contain
         the selected objects).

      By QCD Slots (Q key icon)
         Filter collections by those designated as QCD slots (show only collections that
         correspond to a QCD slot). Shown only if QCD is enabled in the preferences.

      .. hint::

         All options can be combined with each other.

Add Collection, Add Subcollection
   Self-explanatory.

   .. note::

      If the tree view is filtered when adding collections,
      new collections that do not fit the filter rules will be displayed
      until the filtering changes.

Phantom Mode
   All visibility changes made in this mode will be discarded when it's disabled.

   Enabling Phantom Mode saves the current state of the restrictions and
   allows you to edit them without fear of losing their current state.
   When finished, disabling Phantom Mode will restore the saved state.

   Note: You will be unable to edit anything other than the restrictions while in Phantom Mode.

Apply Phantom Mode (check mark icon)
   Applies all changes made to RTOs while in Phantom Mode and exits the mode.


QCD
---

The Quick Content Display system provides a way to rapidly interact with
collections by allowing you to designate up to 20 collections as QCD slots.
You can then interact with these slots by using hotkeys or the widget
to view or move objects to them.

3D Viewport Header Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The header widget is composed of the Quick View Toggles button and 20 QCD slots.

Quick View Toggles (eye icon)
   - Enable All QCD Slots.
   - Enable All QCD Slots Isolated. (Enables all QCD slots and disables any non QCD slots)
   - Disable All Non QCD Slots.
   - Disable All Collections.
   - Select All QCD Objects. (Select all objects that belong to enabled QCD slots)
   - Discard QCD History. (Discards previous QCD slot states)


   .. rubric:: Hotkeys

   - :kbd:`LMB` -- Enable All QCD Slots.
   - :kbd:`Alt-LMB` -- Select All QCD Objects.
   - :kbd:`LMB` hold down -- Opens a menu with all Quick View Toggles.


QCD Slots
   20 buttons in two rows in groups of five
   where the first row starts with slot 1 and the second with slot 11.

   The state of each slot is shown with a combination of the following indicators:

   - ``x`` -- Unassigned slot.
   - ``non-highlighted`` -- non-visible slot.
   - ``highlighted`` -- visible slot.
   - ``no icon`` -- no objects in the slot.
   - ``horizontal line icon`` -- objects are present in this slot.
   - ``circle icon`` -- one or more objects in this slot are selected.
   - ``dot icon`` -- the active object is in this slot.


   .. rubric:: Hotkeys

   - :kbd:`LMB` -- View single slot excluding all others.
   - :kbd:`Shift-LMB` -- Add/remove slot to/from view.
   - :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` -- Move selected objects to slot.
   - :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB` -- Add/remove selected objects to/from slot.
   - :kbd:`Alt-LMB` -- Replace selection with objects in this slot.
   - :kbd:`Shift-Alt-LMB` -- Add/remove slot objects to/from the selection.


Move Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use :kbd:`V` to call up the Move widget in the 3D Viewport when in Object Mode.
It can also be found in the :menuselection:`Object -> Collection` menu.

The Move Widget shares its layout and indicators with the 3D Viewport header widget.


.. rubric:: Hotkeys

- :kbd:`LMB` -- Move selected objects to slot.
- :kbd:`Shift-LMB` -- Add/remove selected objects to/from slot.

- :kbd:`Shift-0` - :kbd:`Shift-9` -- Add/remove selected objects to/from slot 1-10 (0 is slot 10).
- :kbd:`Shift-Alt-0` - :kbd:`Shift-Alt-9` -- Add/remove selected objects to/from slot 11-20 (0 is slot 20).

Preferences
===========

QCD
   Enable the QCD system.
QCD Hotkeys
   Enable 3D Viewport hotkeys in Object Mode.
QCD Edit Mode Hotkeys
   Enable 3D Viewport hotkeys in Edit Mode.

QCD Move Widget:
   Tool Theme Overrides
      Enable overrides in this section to change the color of individual elements

      Icon Alpha
         Opacity of the icons for selected (but not active) objects and unselected objects.

            The values for icon alpha are not overrides and always affect the QCD Move Widget.


Known Issues
============

- Linked collections are not supported.
- Two QCD slots can swap collections if the collections are under the same parent and
  you rename one collection with the name of the other, then undo the rename and redo the rename.
