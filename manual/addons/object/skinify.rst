Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Object then Skinify Rig to enable the script.


Usage
=====

Select your armature in Pose Mode and skin the selected or all bones with a per-bone mesh or whole cover.
If bones in your rig give unwanted results, often scaling and re-positioning the bones in Edit Mode can help.
If you are doing this to create your own "Skinify Guy" you can also delete bones.
It will work with custom shapes but results may vary.
