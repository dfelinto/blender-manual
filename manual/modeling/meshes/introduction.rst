Mesh Modeling typically begins with
a :doc:`Mesh Primitive </modeling/meshes/primitives>` shape (e.g. circle, cube, cylinder...).
From there you might begin editing to create a larger, more complex shape.


Modeling Modes
==============

The 3D Viewport has three principal modes that allow for the creation,
editing and manipulation of the mesh models.
Each of the three modes has a variety of tools. Some tools may be found in one or more of the modes.

Modes that used for modeling:

Object Mode
   Supports basic operations such as object creation,
   joining objects, managing shape keys, UV/color layers.
Edit Mode
   Used for the majority of mesh editing operations.
Sculpt Mode
   Instead of dealing with individual mesh elements,
   supports sculpting with brushes *(not covered in this chapter)*.
