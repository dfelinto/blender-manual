   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-M`

Select Mirror flips a selection to the opposite side of the mesh.

Axis
   Choose on which axis the selection will occur. The axis is based on the meshes origin.
   Therefore, if the origin is not centered within the mesh, the selection will have varying results.

Extend
   The new selection will include the mirrored selection as well as the original.

.. tip::

   With *Extend* activated, hold :kbd:`Shift` while choosing an axis to include more than one axis in the selection.
   Otherwise, with *Extend* off, the mirror will take into account two to three axes.
