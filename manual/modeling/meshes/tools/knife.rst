   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`K`

The Knife tool can be used to interactively subdivide (cut up)
geometry by drawing lines or closed loops to create holes.


Usage
=====

When using *Knife*, the cursor changes to an icon of a scalpel
and the header changes to display options for the tool.
You can draw connected straight lines by clicking :kbd:`LMB`,
marked with small green squares. Red squares are already defined cuts.
Surrounding red squares mean that there is a cut already in that position,
so no additional vertex will be created (besides the first one).

Tool Settings
=============

Occlude Geometry
   Only cut geometry visible on screen.

Only Selected :kbd:`Shift-K`
   Only cuts through selected geometry.


Controls
========

Confirm :kbd:`LMB` or :kbd:`Return`
   Confirms the cut.
   :kbd:`Return` will leave selected every edge except the new edges created from the cut.

Cancel
   Cancels the tool.

Draw a Continuous Line :kbd:`LMB` drag.
   So you can draw a free-hand line over a surface,
   points will be created at edge intersections.

Close Loop double-click :kbd:`LMB`
   This is a quick way to close the loop you are currently cutting.

New Cut :kbd:`E`
   Begins a new cut. This allows you to define multiple distinct cut lines.
   If multiple cuts have been defined, they are recognized as new snapping points.

             Result of starting new cuts while in the tool.

Midpoint Snap :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Hold to snap the cursor to the midpoint of edges,
   meaning that all cuts will be performed at the exact center of each cut edge.

Ignore Snap :kbd:`Shift`
   Hold to make the tool ignore snapping,
   unlike the default where mouse cursor snaps to near edges.

Cut Through: :kbd:`Z`
   Allow the Cut tool to cut through to obscured faces, instead of only the visible ones.

Angle Constrain :kbd:`C`
   Constrains the cut to 45 degree increments.

Known Limitations
=================

Duplicate Vertices
------------------

If you experience problems where duplicate vertices are being created by cuts,
this is often caused by too large a near/far clipping range.

Try increasing the *Clip Start* to avoid this problem,
see :ref:`Depth Troubleshooting <troubleshooting-depth>` for details.


Unconnected Cuts
----------------

Cuts that begin or end in the middle of a face, will be ignored.

*This is constrained by the kinds of geometry Blender can represent.*
