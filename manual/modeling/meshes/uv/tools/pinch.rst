Brushes
   The :ref:`ui-data-block` to select a preset brush type or a custom brush.


Brush Settings
--------------

Radius
   This option controls the radius of the brush, measured in pixels.
   :kbd:`F` allows you to change the brush size interactively by dragging the mouse and then :kbd:`LMB`.
   Typing a number then enter while using :kbd:`F` allows you to enter the size numerically.

   Size Pressure
      Brush size can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
      if you are using a :ref:`Graphics Tablet <hardware-tablet>`.
   Use Unified Radius
      Use the same brush *Radius* across all brushes.

Strength
   Controls how much each application of the brush affects the UVs.
   You can change the brush strength interactively by pressing :kbd:`Shift-F`
   in the 3D Viewport and then moving the brush and then :kbd:`LMB`.
   You can enter the size numerically also while in :kbd:`Shift-F` sizing.

   Use Unified Strength
      Use the same brush *Strength* across all brushes.

.. note::

   All brushes use the :doc:`Airbrush Stroke Method </sculpt_paint/brush/stroke>`;
   they continue to act as long as you keep :kbd:`LMB` pressed.


Falloff
^^^^^^^

The Falloff allows you to control the *Strength* falloff of the brush.
See :doc:`Painting Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>` for more information.
