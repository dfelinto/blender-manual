Alternatively, you can choose which faces to smooth by entering *Edit Mode*,
then selecting some faces and picking *Shade Smooth* from the *Face Menu*.

When the mesh is in *Edit Mode*,
only the selected faces will receive the "smoothing" attribute.
You can set faces as flat (removing the "smoothing" attribute)
in the same way by selecting edges and picking the *Shade Flat* from the *Face Menu*.
