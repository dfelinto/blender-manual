********************************
Vertex Weight Proximity Modifier
********************************

This modifier sets the weights of the given vertex group,
based on the distance between the object (or its vertices),
and another target object (or its geometry).

.. warning::

   This modifier does implicit clamping of weight values in the standard (0.0 to 1.0) range.
   All values below 0.0 will be set to 0.0, and all values above 1.0 will be set to 1.0.

.. note::

   You can view the modified weights in Weight Paint Mode.
   This also implies that you will have to disable the *Vertex Weight Proximity* modifier
   if you want to see the original weights of the vertex group you are editing.

   The Vertex Weight Proximity modifier panel.

Vertex Group
   The vertex group to affect.

Target Object
   The object from which to compute distances.

Proximity Mode
   Object Distance
      Use the distance between the modified mesh object and the target object as
      weight for all vertices in the affected vertex group.
   Geometry Distance
      Use the distance between each vertex and the target object, or its geometry.

      Vertex
         This will set each vertex's weight from its distance to the nearest vertex of the target object.
      Edge
         This will set each vertex's weight from its distance to the nearest edge of the target object.
      Face
         This will set each vertex's weight from its distance to the nearest face of the target object.

      .. note::

         If you enable more than one of them, the shortest distance will be used.
         If the target object has no geometry (e.g. an empty or camera),
         it will use the location of the object itself.

Lowest
   Distance mapping to 0.0 weight.
Highest
   Distance mapping to 1.0 weight.

.. tip::

   *Lowest* can be set above *Highest* to reverse the mapping.

Normalize Weights
   Scale the weights in the vertex group to keep the relative weight
   but the lowest and highest values follow the full 0 - 1 range.


Falloff
-------

Type
   Type of mapping.

   Linear
      No mapping.
   Custom Curve
      Allows you to manually define the mapping using a curve.
   Sharp, Smooth, Root and Sphere
      These are classical mapping functions, from spikiest to roundest.
   Random
      Uses a random value for each vertex.
   Median Step
      Creates binary weights (0.0 or 1.0), with 0.5 as cutting value.

Invert ``<-->``
   Inverts the falloff.


Influence
---------

Those settings are the same for the three *Vertex Weight* modifiers,
see the :ref:`Vertex Weight Edit modifier <modeling-modifiers-weight-edit-influence-mask-options>` page.
