Weighted Normal Modifier
************************

This modifier changes the custom normals of a mesh, using various selectable methods.
This can be useful to make some faces appear very flat during shading, among other effects.
See :doc:`Normals </modeling/meshes/editing/mesh/normals>` for a description of normals
and custom normals.

.. note::

   This modifier requires custom normals to be enabled, which can be done by
   enabling :ref:`Auto Smooth <auto-smooth>` in the :menuselection:`Properties --> Object Data --> Normals`.

Weighting Mode
   The normals around a vertex will be combined to create a custom (per face corner) normal
   using various weights for each. The *Weighting Mode* defines how to compute the weights.

   Face Area
      Weight according to the area of the face that the normal originates.
      A larger area means that the normal from that face will get a higher weight in final result.

   Corner Angle
      Weight according to the angle each face forms at the vertex.
      This is the method Blender uses by default when combining face normals to compute a vertex one.

   Face Area and Angle
      Weights are obtained by multiplying the face area and corner angle ones.

Weight
   Determines how strongly the weights are biased according to the face areas and/or corner angles,
   a bit like a contrast setting for a picture.

   A value of 50 means all faces are weighted uniformly.
   More than 50 means faces with higher area or angles are given even more weight (more "contrast").
   Less than 50 means faces with higher area or angles are given lesser weights (less "contrast").

Threshold
   A weight-rounding threshold which means that, if two angles or areas differ by less than that threshold,
   they will get equal weights.

Keep Sharp
   Preserve :ref:`sharp edges <modeling_meshes_normals_sharp_edge>`,
   though smoothing will still happen if there are multiple faces between any two sharp edges.

Face Influence
   Use face weights (weak, medium, or strong) as assigned by
   the :doc:`Set Strength </modeling/meshes/editing/mesh/normals>` tool or
   by the *Set Strength* mode of a :doc:`Bevel </modeling/modifiers/generate/bevel>` modifier.

   For example, if three faces meet at a vertex and have the face weights weak, medium, and strong,
   then only the normal associated with the strong face will be used to set the final result.

Vertex Group
   If a vertex group is specified, the modifier will only affect those vertices.
   The "arrow" button to its right will invert the selection (only affect the vertices *not* in the vertex group).
