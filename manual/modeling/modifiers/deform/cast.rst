*************
Cast Modifier
*************

The *Cast* modifier shifts the shape of a mesh, curve,
surface or lattice, towards any of a few predefined shapes (sphere, cylinder, cuboid).

It is equivalent to the :ref:`To Sphere <tool-transform-to_sphere>` tool in Edit Mode,
and what other programs call "Spherify" or "Spherize", but, as written above,
it is not limited to casting to a sphere.

.. tip::

   The :doc:`Smooth Modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/smooth>` is a good companion to *Cast*,
   since the cast shape sometimes needs smoothing to look nicer or even to fix shading artifacts.

.. note::

   For performance reasons, this modifier only works with local coordinates.
   If the modified object looks wrong, you may need to apply its
   :ref:`transformations <bpy.ops.object.transform_apply>`, especially when casting to a cylinder.

   The Cast modifier.

Shape
   Menu to choose target shape of the projection: *Sphere*, *Cylinder* or *Cuboid*.

Axis
   Toggle buttons to enable/disable the modifier in the X, Y, Z axes directions
   (X and Y only for *Cylinder* cast type, since the Z axis remains unaffected).

Factor
   The factor to control blending between original and cast vertex positions.

   It is a linear interpolation: 0.0 gives original coordinates (i.e. modifier has no effect),
   1.0 casts to the target shape.

   Values below 0.0 or above 1.0 exaggerate the deformation, sometimes in interesting ways.

Radius
   If nonzero, this radius defines a sphere of influence.
   Vertices outside it are not affected by the modifier.

Size
   Alternative size for the projected shape. If zero,
   it is defined by the initial shape and the control object, if any.

Size from Radius
   If activated, calculate *Size* from *Radius*, for smoother results.

Vertex Group
   If set, restrict the effect to the only vertices in that vertex group.
   This allows selective, real-time casting, by painting vertex weights.

   Invert ``<->``
      Inverts the influence of the selected vertex group, meaning that the group
      now represents vertices that will not be deformed by the modifier.

      The setting reverses the weight values of the group.

Object
   The name of an object to control the effect.
   The location of this object's origin defines the center of the projection.
   Also, its size and rotation transform the projected vertices.

   .. hint::

      Animating (keyframing) this control object also animates the modified object's casting deformation.
