Lattice Modifier
****************

The *Lattice* modifier deforms the base object according to
the shape of a :doc:`Lattice </animation/lattice>` object.
Objects to be deformed can be meshes, curves,
surfaces, text, lattices and even particles.

.. tip::

   A *Lattice* modifier can quickly be added to selected objects by
   :ref:`parenting <bpy.ops.object.parent_set>` them using the *Lattice Deform* option.

   The Lattice modifier.

Object
   The :doc:`Lattice </animation/lattice>` object with which to deform the base object.

Vertex Group
   An optional vertex group name which lets you limit the modifier's effect to a part of the base mesh.

   Invert ``<->``
      Inverts the influence of the selected vertex group, meaning that the group
      now represents vertices that will not be deformed by the modifier.

      The setting reverses the weight values of the group.

Strength
   A factor to control blending between original and deformed vertex positions.


Hints
=====

Why would you use a lattice to deform a mesh instead of deforming the mesh itself in Edit Mode?
There are a couple of reasons for that:

- If your object has a large number of vertices, it would be difficult to edit portions of it quickly in Edit Mode.
  Using a lattice will allow you to deform large portions efficiently.
- The smooth deformation you get from a *Lattice* modifier can be hard to achieve manually.
- Multiple objects can use the same lattice, thus allowing you to edit multiple objects at once.
- Like all modifiers, it is non-destructive. Meaning all changes happen on top of the original geometry,
  which you can still go back to and edit without affecting the deformation.
- A lattice does not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface.

.. note::

   When using a lattice to deform particles, order in the :ref:`modifier stack <modifier-stack>` matters.
   You need to place the *Lattice* modifier after the *Particle System* one.
