Remesh Modifier
***************

The *Remesh* modifier is a tool for generating new mesh topology.
The output follows the surface curvature of the input, but its topology contains only quads.

   The Remesh modifier.

Mode
   There are three basic modes available in the *Remesh* modifier.
   The output topology is almost identical between the three modes, what changes is the smoothing.

   Blocks
      There is no smoothing at all.
   Smooth
      Output a smooth surface.
   Sharp
      Similar to *Smooth*, but preserves sharp edges and corners.

      Sharpness
         Higher values produce edges more similar to the input, while lower values filter out noise.
   Voxel
      Uses an OpenVDB to generate a new manifold mesh from the current geometry
      while trying to preserve the mesh's original volume.

      Adaptivity
         Reduces the final face count by simplifying geometry where detail is not needed.
         This introduce triangulation to faces that do not need as much detail.
      Smooth Shading
         Outputs faces with :ref:`Smooth Shading <bpy.ops.object.shade_smooth>` instead of flat shading.

Octree Depth
   Sets the resolution of the output. Low values will generate larger faces relative to the input,
   higher values will generate a denser output.

Scale
   The result can be tweaked further by this, lower values effectively decrease the output resolution.

Remove Disconnected
   Filter out small disconnected pieces of the output.

   Thin parts of the input mesh can become lose, and generate small isolated bits of mesh.
   This option will remove those.

   Threshold
      Use this to control how small a disconnected component must be to be removed.

Smooth Shading
   Output faces with smooth shading rather than flat shading.
   The smooth/flat shading of the input faces is not preserved.

.. note::

   The input mesh should have some thickness to it. If the input is completely flat,
   add a :doc:`Solidify Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/solidify>` above the *Remesh* one.
