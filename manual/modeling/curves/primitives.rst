   When adding curves there are some common options like other :ref:`Objects <object-common-options>`.

In Object/Edit Mode, the *Add Curve* menu, provides five different curve primitives:


Bézier Curve
============

Adds an open 2D Bézier curve with two control points.


Bézier Circle
=============

Adds a closed, circle-shaped 2D Bézier curve (made of four control points).


NURBS Curve
===========

Adds an open 2D :term:`NURBS` curve, with four control points, with *Uniform* knots.


NURBS Circle
============

Adds a closed, circle-shaped 2D :term:`NURBS` curve (made of eight control points).


Path
====

Adds a :term:`NURBS` open 3D curve made of five aligned control points,
with *Endpoint* knots and the *Curve Path* setting enabled.
