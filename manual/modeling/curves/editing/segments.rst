Switch Direction
================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Curve --> Segments --> Switch Direction`

This tool will "reverse" the direction of any curve with at least one selected element
(i.e. the start point will become the end one, and *vice versa*).
This is mainly useful when using a curve as path, or using the bevel and taper options.
