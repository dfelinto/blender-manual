*******
Empties
*******

The "empty" is a single coordinate point with no additional geometry.
Because an empty has no volume and surface, it cannot be rendered.
Still it can be used as a handle for many purposes.

   Empty Display Types.


Plain Axes
----------

Displays as six lines, initially with one pointing in each of the +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, and -Z axis directions.


Arrows
------

Displays as arrows, initially pointing in the positive X, Y, and Z axis directions, each with a label.


Single Arrow
------------

Displays as a single arrow, initially pointing in the +Z axis direction.


Circle
------

Displays as a circle initially in the XZ plane.


Cube
----

Displays as a cube, initially aligned to the XYZ axes.


Sphere
------

Displays as an implied sphere defined by three circles.
Initially, the circles are aligned, one each, to the X, Y, and Z axes.


Cone
----

Displays as a cone, initially pointing in the +Y axis direction.


.. _bpy.types.Object.empty_image:

Image
-----

Empties can display images. This can be used to create reference images,
including blueprints or character sheets to model from.
The image is displayed regardless of the 3D display mode.

Empty Displays settings can be accessed from :menuselection:`Properties --> Object Data --> Empty` panel.

Offset X, Y
   Offset the image origin
   (where 1.0 represents the width/height of the image).

   :X=0.5, Y=0.5: Object origin at image center.
   :X=0.0, Y=0.0: Object origin at image bottom, left.
   :X=1.0, Y=1.0: Object origin at image top, right.

Depth
   :Default: Use normal depth behavior.
   :Front: Always display on top of other objects.
   :Back: Always display behind of other objects.

   .. tip::

      When using the image as a reference for modeling,
      it can be useful to set the depth to *Front*, with a low *Opacity*.

Side
   :Both: Display both the front and back of the empty.
   :Front: Only display the front of the image.
   :Back: Only display the back of the image.

   .. tip::

      This is useful if you are using an image as a reference where you have photos from
      both the front and back,
      so two empty images can be set only to show when viewed from the correct side.

Show in
   Orthographic
      Show in orthographic view.
   Perspective
      Show in perspective view.

      .. hint::

         It's often useful to disable this so reference images don't
         *get in the way* when viewing a model.
   Only Axis Aligned
      Only displays the image contents when the view is aligned with the object's local axis.

.. _bpy.types.Object.use_empty_image_alpha:

Opacity
   Blends the image with the background. The value slider adjusts the opacity of the image,
   changing how much of the image is blended with the background.


Editing
=======

An empty can only be edited in Object Mode, which includes its transformation and parenting properties.
For other tools see the :doc:`Object section </scene_layout/object/index>`.

Apply Scale :kbd:`Ctrl-A`
   While empties don't exactly have any object data attached to them which can be used for supporting
   "true" apply scale (i.e. with non-uniform scaling), they do have *Display Size* which controls how
   large the empties are displayed (before scaling). This works by taking the scale factor on the most-scaled axis,
   and combines this with the existing empty *Display Size* to maintain the correct dimensions on that axis.


.. _bpy.types.Object.empty_display_type:
.. _bpy.types.Object.empty_display_size:

Properties
==========

Display As
   The `Primitives`_ empty type to display in the 3D Viewport.

Size
   Controls the size of the empties visualization. This does not change its scale, but functions as an offset.


Usage
=====

Empties can serve as transform handles. Some examples of ways to use them include:


.. rubric:: Parent object for a group of objects

An empty can be parented to any number of other objects.
This gives the user the ability to control a group of objects easily, and without affecting a render.


.. rubric:: Target for constraints

An empty can also be used as a target for normal, or bone constraints.
This gives the user far more control; for instance,
a rig can easily be set up to enable a camera to point towards an empty using the *Track to* constraint.


.. rubric:: Array offset

An empty can be used to offset an Array Modifier,
meaning complex deformations can be achieved by only moving a single object.
