***********
Point Cloud
***********

:term:`Point clouds <Point Cloud>` can be used to represent 3D scans and
in the future can represent particles. Each point can store data in a set of `Attributes`_.

   Example of a monkey object represented as a point cloud.


Properties
==========

Attributes
----------

The *Attributes* panel contains different point cloud characteristics such as the position and size of points.

Use the :ref:`List View <ui-list-view>` to manage attributes.


Attribute Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. seealso::

   See :ref:`geometry-nodes_builtin-attributes` for infomation about common attributes.

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Domain
     - Notes

   * - **position**
     - *Vector*
     - *Point*
     - Built-in attribute describing vertex or point locations, in the modifier object's transform space.

   * - **radius**
     - *Float*
     - *Point*
     - The radius of each point.

   * - **radius**
     - *Color*
     - *Point*
     - The color of each point.

   * - **id**
     - *Integer*
     - *Point*
     - A unique identifier given to each particle.

   * - **velocity**
     - *Vector*
     - *Point*
     - The speed and direction that the particle is traveling.

Custom Attributes
   Custom attribute can be given to particles to hold a custom characteristic.

   Name
      The name of the attribute.
   Data Type
      The type of data to store in the attribute.

      :Float: Floating-point value
      :Integer: 32-bit integer
      :Vector: 3D vector with floating-point values
      :Color: RGBA color with floating-point precision
      :Byte Color: RGBA color with 8-bit precision
      :String: Text string

   Domain
      The type of element the attribute is stored in.
      Currently, attributes can only be stored per *Point*.


Custom Properties

Editing
=======

Currently, not much can be done with point clouds; however,
they can be :doc:`converted to/from meshes </scene_layout/object/editing/convert>`.
