   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Properties --> Metaball`

All meta objects of a same :ref:`family <meta-ball-object-families>` in a scene interact with each other.
The settings in the *Metaball* section apply to all meta objects of the active family.
In Edit Mode, the *Active Element* panel is shown for :ref:`editing <meta-ball-editing>` individual metaball elements.

          Individual meta properties.


Resolution
==========

The *Resolution* controls the resolution of the resultant mesh as generated by the *Meta* objects.

Viewport
   The 3D Viewport resolution of the generated mesh; finest to coarsest.
Render
   The rendered resolution of the generated mesh; finest to coarsest.

One way to see the underlying mathematical structure is to lower the *Resolution*,
increase the *Threshold* and set the *Stiffness* (see below)
a fraction above the *Threshold*. Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-intro-underlying` is a meta cube
with the above mentioned configuration applied as follows:
*Resolution* of 0.410, *Threshold* of 5.0 and *Stiffness* a fraction above at 5.01.

          Underlying structure.

     - .. figure:: /images/modeling_metas_properties_underlying-structure-shape.png

          Meta cube shape.

You can clearly see the underlying cubic structure that gives the meta cube its shape.


Influence Threshold
===================

*Influence Threshold* defines how much a meta's surface "influences" other metas.
It controls the *field level* at which the surface is computed.
The setting is global to a group of *Meta* objects.
As the threshold increases, so does the influence that each meta has on each other.

There are two types of :ref:`influence <meta-ball-editing-negative-influence>`: *positive* or *negative*.


Update
======

While transforming metas (move, scale, etc.), you have four "modes" of visualization,
located in the *Update* buttons group of the *Metaball* panel:

Always
   Fully display the meta during transformations.
Half
   During transformations, display the meta at half its *Viewport* resolution.
Fast
   Do not display meta during transformations.
Never
   Never show meta mesh (not a very recommended option, as the meta is only visible at render time!).

This should help you if you experience difficulties (metas are quite computationally intensive...),
but with modern computers, this should not happen, unless you use many metas,
or very high resolutions...
