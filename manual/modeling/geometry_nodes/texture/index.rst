Nodes to add textures.

.. tip::

   Texture nodes can produce details at a higher frequency
   than geometry can show. This is more evident with textures
   that produce abrupt changes such as brick and checker.
   This may cause aritfacts such as moire type patterns 
   or a lack of detail due to insufficient sampling points.
