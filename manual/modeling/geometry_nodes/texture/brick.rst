Brick Texture Node
******************

.. note::

   This node is ported from shader nodes. The manual and images are
   referencing the shader version of the node.
   This node accepts field inputs and outputs.
   When not connected the Vector input has an implicit ``position`` attribute value.
   
.. tip::

   Texture nodes can produce details at a higher frequency
   than geometry can show. This may cause artifacts such
   as Moiré type patterns or a lack of detail due to
   insufficient sampling points.

   Brick Texture node.

The *Brick Texture* is used to add a procedural texture producing bricks.


Inputs
======

Color 1/2
   Color of the bricks.
Mortar
   The color of the area between bricks.
Scale
   Overall texture scale.
Mortar Size
   The size of the filling between the bricks known as "mortar"; 0 means no mortar.
Mortar Smooth
   Blurs/softens the edge between the mortar and the bricks.
   This can be useful with a texture and displacement textures.
Bias
   The color variation between *Color 1/2*.
   Values of -1 and 1 only use one of the two colors; values in between mix the colors.
Brick Width
   The width of the bricks.
Row Height
   The height of the brick rows.


Properties
==========

Offset
   Determines the brick offset of the various rows.
Frequency
   Determines the offset frequency. A value of 2 gives an even/uneven pattern of rows.
Squash
   Amount of brick squashing.
Frequency
   Brick squashing frequency.


Outputs
=======

Color
   Texture color output.
Factor
   Mortar mask (1 = mortar).


Examples
========
