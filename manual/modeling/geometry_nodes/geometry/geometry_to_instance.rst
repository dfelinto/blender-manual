Geometry to Instance Node

   The Geometry to Instance node.

The *Geometry to Instance* node turns every connected input geometry into an instance.
Visually, the node has a similar result as the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/geometry/join_geometry`,
but it outputs the result as separate instances instead. The geometry data itself isn't actually
joined.

The node can be used in combination with the *Pick Instances* option in the
:doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/instance_on_points`, as a way to pick
between geometry generated in the node tree (as opposed to picking from separate
instances from the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/input/collection_info`, for example).

.. tip::

   This node can be much faster than the join geometry node when the inputs are large geometries.
   This is because the join geometry node must actually create a larger mesh, or a larger curve.
   Even though the operation is simple, just creating a large mesh can have a significant cost.
   This node can be better, because instead of merging large geometries, it just groups them
   together as instances.


Inputs
======

Geometry
   Geometry that will be joined. Multiple inputs are allowed.
   When the node is muted, only the first link will be passed through.


Properties
==========

This node has no properties.


Output
======

Geometry
   Standard geometry output.


Examples

The node used in combination with the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/instance_on_points`
to choose between multiple primitives for instancing.
