   The Bounding Box node.

The *Bounding Box* node creates a box mesh with the minimum volume that encapsulates
the geometry of the input. The node also can output the vector positions of the bounding dimensions.

The mesh output and the *Min* and *Max* outputs do not take instances into account. Instead,
for instanced geometry, a bounding box is computed for each instance rather than the whole geometry.
To compute the bounding box including the instances,
a :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/realize_instances` can be used.


Inputs
======

Geometry
   Standard geometry input.


Properties
==========

This node has no properties.


Outputs
=======

Bounding Box
   The resulting box that encapsulate the input geometry.

Min
   The coordinates corresponding to the box's -X, -Y, -Z position values,
   i.e. how far the box extends in each of the negative axes directions.

Max
   The coordinates corresponding to the box's +X, +Y, +Z position values,
   i.e. how far the box extends in each of the positive axes directions.


Example
=======

   Bounding Box node used to create a box that encapsulates the geometry of the monkey mesh.
