   The Geometry Proximity node.

The *Geometry Proximity* node computes the closest location on the target geometry.

.. tip::

   The :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/utilities/map_range` is often helpful to use with the distance
   output of this node to create a falloff with a maximum distance.


Inputs
======

Target
   Standard geometry input.

Source Position
   The given position to calculate the closest location on the target.


Properties
==========

Target Element
   :Faces:
      Calculate the closest point anywhere on the faces of the target's mesh geometry.
   :Edges:
      Calculate the closest point anywhere on the edges of the target's mesh geometry.
   :Points:
      Calculate the closest point or vertex on the target geometry. This mode is usually the fastest.
      This mode works for both point cloud and mesh geometry, the other modes only work for meshes.


Outputs
=======

Position
   Closest location on the surface of the target mesh, or the closest point in the target point cloud
   in *Points* mode.

Distance
   Distance (as floating-point value) from the source position to the closest location in the target.


Examples
========

The different modes of the node: faces, edges and points.
In this example the Geometry Nodes modifier is added on the target plane.
Note that the larger plane is subdivided and the smaller plane is not.
