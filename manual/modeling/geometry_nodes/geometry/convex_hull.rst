   :alt: Convex Hull node.

The *Convex Hull* node outputs a convex mesh that is enclosing all points in the input geometry.

.. note::

   When the node is used on a geometry with instances, the algorithm will run once per instance,
   resulting in many convex hull meshes in the instance geometries. The *Realize Instances* node can
   be used to get a convex hull of an entire geometry.

.. important::

   Volumes are not supported by this node, and attributes are not automatically transferred to the result.
