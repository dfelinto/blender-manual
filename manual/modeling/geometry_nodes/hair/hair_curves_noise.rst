Hair Curves Noise
*****************

Deforms hair curves using a noise texture.


Inputs
======

**Geometry**

Cumulative Offset
   Apply offset cumulatively (previous points affect points after).

Distance
   Overall distance factor for the deformation.

Factor
   Overall factor for the deformation.

Shape
   Shape of amount along each curve (0=constant, 0.5=linear).

Scale
   Scale of the noise texture by root position.

Scale along Curve
   Scale of noise texture along each Curve.

Offset per Curve
   Random offset of noise texture for each Curve.

Seed
   Seed value for randomization.

Preserve Length
   Preserve the length of the Curves on a segment basis.
