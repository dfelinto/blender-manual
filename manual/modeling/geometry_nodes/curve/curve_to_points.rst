   Curve to Points node.

The *Curve to Points* node generates a point cloud from a curve.


Inputs
======

Curve
   Standard curve input.

Count
   Number of points generated. This input is only available for *Count* mode.

Length
   Length of the curve. This input is only available for *Length* mode.

Properties
==========

Mode
   :Evaluated: 
      Creates points from the curve's evaluated points based on the
      :doc:`resolution </modeling/geometry_nodes/curve/spline_resolution>`
      attribute for NURBS and BÃ©zier splines. This mode will generally be the fastest, 
      since the second step of sampling equal lengths is not necessary.

   :Count: 
      Sample each spline by evenly distributing the specified number of points.

   :Length: 
      Sample each spline by splitting it into segments with specified length.
      The length will be rounded down so that a whole number of samples will fit in each input spline.
      To counteract jumping when the length of the spline changes, the 
      :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/curve/trim_curve` can be used with a multiple of this length.


Outputs
=======

Points
   Generated point cloud.
