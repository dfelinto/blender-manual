   Spline Length node.

The *Spline Length* node outputs the total length of each spline, as a distance, or a number of points.
This is different than the :doc:`Curve Length </modeling/geometry_nodes/curve/curve_length>` node,
which adds up the total length for all of the curve's splines.

The output values correspond to the spline domain, but the node can be used to output a value for every
curve control point as well.
