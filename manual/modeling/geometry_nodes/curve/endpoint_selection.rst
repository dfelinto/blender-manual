   Endpoint Selection node.

The *Endpoint Selection* node provides a selection for an arbitrary number of endpoints in each spline in a curve.

.. note::

   The selection operates for every control point. This may not correspond to the evaluated
   points displayed in the viewport for NURBS and BÃ©zier splines, where one control point may
   correspond to many evaluated points.

.. tip::

   To use this data after the curve has been converted to another data type like mesh or a point cloud,
   the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/attribute/capture_attribute` can be used.


Inputs
======

Start Size
   The number of points to select from the start.

End Size
   The number of points to select from the end.


Properties
==========

This node has no properties.


Outputs
=======

Selection
   Selection of start and end of each spline of the curve.


Examples
========

Anywhere the geometry is a curve, this node can be used to generate a selection of
only the first and last points of each spline. Here, the *Points* input of
the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/point/distribute_points_on_faces` is a curve
consisting of the poly spline shown in Edit Mode.
