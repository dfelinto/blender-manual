   :align: right
   :alt: Instance Rotation node.

The *Instance Rotation* outputs the XYZ :term:`Euler` rotation of each top-level instance in the
local space of the modifier object. 

The :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances` page contains more information about geometry instances.

.. note::

   Though rotations are often displayed in units of degrees in the spreadsheet or node editor,
   they are stored internally in radians, so this node outputs radians.
