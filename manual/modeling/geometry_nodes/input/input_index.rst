   Index Node.

The *Index Node* gives an integer value indicating the position of each element in the list. 
This depends on the internal order of the data in the geometry, which is not necessarily
visible in the 3D viewport. However, the index value is visible in the left-most column in
the :doc:`Spreadsheet Editor </editors/spreadsheet>`.
