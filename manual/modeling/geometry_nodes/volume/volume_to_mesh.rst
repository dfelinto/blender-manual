   The Volume to Mesh node.

The *Volume to Mesh* node generates a mesh on the "surface" of a volume.
The surface is defined by a threshold value.
All voxels with a larger value than the threshold are considered to be inside.


Inputs
======

Volume
   Standard geometry input.

Voxel Amount
   Specifies the approximate resolution of the final mesh.
   The voxel size is adapted to the size of the entire volume.

Voxel Size
   Use a fixed resolution that does not change when the volume changes.

Threshold
   Voxels with a larger value are considered to be inside the mesh.
   The mesh will be generated on the boundary of inside and outside voxels.
   This is also called "iso value".

Adaptivity
   Reduces the final face count by simplifying geometry where detail is not needed.
   This is similar to decimating the final to reduce resolution where it is not needed.


Properties
==========

Resolution Mode
   Mode for how the resolution of the final mesh is controlled.

   :Grid:
      This makes the resolution dependent on the resolution of the grid that is converted.
      Higher resolution grids result in a higher resolution mesh.
      In many cases, that is the most efficient mode.
   :Voxel Amount:
      Specifies the approximate resolution of the final mesh.
      The voxel size is adapted to the size of the entire volume.
   :Voxel Size:
      Use a fixed resolution that does not change when the volume changes.

   .. note::

      This option applies individually for every grid in the input geometry.

Outputs
=======

Mesh
   Standard geometry output.
