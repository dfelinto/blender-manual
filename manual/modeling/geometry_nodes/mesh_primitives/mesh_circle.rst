   Mesh Circle Node.

The *Mesh Circle* node generates a circular ring of edges that is optionally filled with faces.


Inputs
======

Vertices
   Number of vertices on the circle.
   No geometry is generated when the number is below three.

Radius
   Distance of the vertices from the origin.


Properties
==========

Fill Type
   How the circle is filled with faces.

   :None: Output just the edge ring without any faces.
   :N-Gon: Fill the circle with a single face.
   :Triangles: Fill the circle with triangles connected to a new vertex at the origin.


Outputs
=======

Mesh
   Standard geometry output.
