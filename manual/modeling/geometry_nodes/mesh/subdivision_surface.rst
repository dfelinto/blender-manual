The *Subdivision Surface* node adds new faces to mesh geometry using a Catmull-Clark subdivision method.


Inputs
======

Mesh
   Standard geometry input.

Level
   The number of subdivisions to apply to the input geometry.
Crease
   Controls how smooth edges should be with :ref:`modifiers-generate-subsurf-creases`.


Properties
==========

UV Smooth
   Controls how subdivision smoothing is applied to UVs.

   :None: UVs remain unchanged.
   :Keep Corners: UV islands are smoothed, but their boundary remain unchanged.
   :Keep Corners, Junctions:
      UVs are smoothed, corners on discontinuous boundary and junctions of three or more regions are kept sharp.
   :Keep Corners, Junctions, Concave:
      UVs are smoothed, corners on discontinuous boundary,
      junctions of three or more regions and darts and concave corners are kept sharp.
   :Keep Boundaries: UVs are smoothed, boundaries are kept sharp.
   :All: UVs and their boundaries are smoothed.

Boundary Smooth
   Controls how open boundaries (and corners) are smoothed.

   :All: Smooth boundaries, including corners.
   :Keep Corners: Smooth boundaries, but corners are kept sharp.


Outputs
=======

Mesh
   Standard geometry output.
