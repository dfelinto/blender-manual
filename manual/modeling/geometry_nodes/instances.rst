   The three types of instances.

In addition to storing real data like a mesh or a curve, a geometry can store instances,
which themselves can reference more geometry, or an object, or a collection. The purpose
of instancing is to allow including much more geometry in the result, without duplicating
the actual data. This is because renderer like :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/index>`
can handle the same geometry data in many different locations better than when the data
is duplicated.

Each instance keeps track of which geometry it corresponds to, and a :term:`Transform`.
Instances can also store the ``id`` attribute, used for correct motion blur when instances
move in an animation.

The main node used to create instances in geometry nodes
is the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/instance_on_points`.


.. warning::

   Currently instancing from geometry nodes cannot be mixed with instancing from the
   :doc:`/scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/index` panel in the property editor.


.. _geometry-nodes_nested-instancing:

Nested Instancing
=================

Since instances can store a geometry, and a geometry can contain instances, nested instancing is possible.
In other words, it is possible to instance an instance, or even a collection of instances.
By default, the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/instance_on_points` will create
nested instances by instancing on the points real geometry and instanced geometry.

   A node group that creates nested instancing by chaining
   :doc:`instance on points </modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/instance_on_points>` nodes.

Here, nested instancing is used to distribute geometry that contains both a mesh
and instances. The output geometry contains a "real" mesh, and a group of instances.
Each instance contains a sphere mesh and many instances of a cone geometry.

   The tree of instanced geometry for the example above.

What makes this method helpful is that the output geometry only contains three unique meshes:
the plane, the sphere, and the cone. This would make the performance much better if the meshes
were more complicated.


.. _geometry-nodes_instance-processing:

Instance Processing
===================

Almost all nodes that process geometry do so by processing each unique
geometry in their input's tree of instances separately. For example,
if a :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/mesh/subdivision_surface` was placed at
the end of the example above, it would only have to subdivide three meshes,
rather than each instance of a mesh. Another important example is processing with
the output of the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/text/string_to_curves`,
where each unique character only has to be processed once.

This method can improve performance a lot, but it means that the result of an operation
will be the same for every instance of a certain geometry. In order to have unique results
for every instance, the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/instances/realize_instances`
node can be used.
