   :alt: Curve of Point node.

The *Curve of Point* node retrieves the index of the curve a control point is part of.
This node is conceptually similar to the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/mesh_topology/face_of_corner`.


Inputs
======

Point Index
   The index of the input control point.

   .. note::
      By default this uses the :doc:`index </modeling/geometry_nodes/input/input_index>`
      from the field context, which makes it important that the node is evaluated on
      the point domain.


Properties
==========

This node has no properties.


Outputs
=======

Curve Index
   The index of the curve the control point is part of.

Index in Curve
   How far along the control point is along its curve, with a value of 0 for the first point in each curve.
