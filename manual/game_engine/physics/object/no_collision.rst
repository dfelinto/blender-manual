No Collision Physics Object Type
********************************

"No Collision" objects in the :doc:`Game Engine </game_engine>` are completely unaffected by :doc:`Physics </game_engine/physics>`, and do cause physics reactions. They are useful as pure display objects, such as the child of a :doc:`Custom Collision Hull </game_engine/physics/collision_bounds>`.

In the example game demo, :doc:`Frijoles </ls/frijoles>`, the No Collision type is represented by the "HUD" objects that display the health status.

For more documentation, see the :doc:`Top BGE Physics page </game_engine/physics>`.
