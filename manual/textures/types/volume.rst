Volume Textures
***************

Blender has two textures that can be applied to volumetric data:

:doc:`Voxel Data </textures/types/volume/voxel_data>`
   Voxel data renders a voxel source. It can be used for rendering Blender's internal smoke simulations. Other sources include binary raw formats, and Image Sequence, which can be used to stack a sequence of images into a 3D representation

:doc:`Point Density </textures/types/volume/point_density>`
   Point density renders a given point cloud (object vertices or particle system) as a 3D volume
