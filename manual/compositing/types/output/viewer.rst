Outputs
=======

This node has no output sockets.

.. note::

   It is possible to add multiple Viewer nodes, though only the active one
   (last selected, indicated by a red header) will be shown on the backdrop or in the Image editor.


Using the Image Editor
======================

The Viewer node allows results to be displayed in the Image Editor.
The image is facilitated in the header by selecting *Viewer Node* in the linked *Image* data-block menu.
The Image Editor will display the image from the currently selected Viewer node.

To save the image being viewed,
use :menuselection:`Image --> Save As...`, :kbd:`Alt-S` to save the image to a file.

The Image Editor also has three additional options in its header to view Images with or
without Alpha, or to view the Alpha or Z itself.
Click and holding the mouse in the Image displayed allows you to sample the values.
