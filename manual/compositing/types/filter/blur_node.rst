   Blur Node.

The Blur node blurs an image, providing several blur modes.


Inputs
======

Image
   Standard image input.
Size
   The optional Size input will be multiplied with the X and Y blur radius values.
   It also accepts a value image, to control the blur radius with a mask.
   The values should be mapped between (0 to 1) for an optimal effect.


Properties
==========

Type
   The difference between the types is in the way they handle sharp edges,
   smooth gradients and preserve the highs and the lows.

   :Flat: Simply blurs everything uniformly.
   :Tent: Preserves the high and the lows better by making a linear falloff.
   :Quadratic: Looks similar to *Gaussian* but can be a little faster but slightly worse looking.
   :Cubic: Preserve the highs, but give an almost out-of-focus blur while smoothing sharp edges.
   :Gaussian: Gives the best looking results but tends to be the slowest.
   :Fast Gaussian: An approximation of the Gaussian.
   :Catmull-Rom: Catmull-Rom keeps sharp contrast edges crisp.
   :Mitch: Preserve the highs, but give an almost out-of-focus blur while smoothing sharp edges.

Variable Size
   Allows a variable blur radius, if the size input is an image.

   Bokeh
      The Bokeh button will force the Blur node to use a circular blur filter.
      This gives higher quality results, but is slower than using a normal filter.
Gamma
   The Gamma button applies a gamma correction on the image before blurring it.
Relative
   Percentage Value of the blur radius relative to the image size.

   Aspect Correction
      None, Y, X
X, Y
   Values set the ellipsoid radius in numbers of pixels over which to spread the blur effect.
Extend Bounds
   Allows the image, that is being blurred, to extend past its original dimension.


Outputs
=======

Image
   Standard image output.
