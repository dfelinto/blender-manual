   Glare Node.

The *Glare node* is used to add lens flares, fog,
glows around exposed parts of an image and much more.


Inputs
======

Image
   Standard image input.


Properties
==========

Glare Type
   :Ghosts:
      Creates a haze over the image.
   :Streaks:
      Creates bright streaks used to simulate lens flares.

      Streaks
         Total number of streaks.
      Angle Offset
         The rotation offset factor of the streaks.
      Fade
         Fade out factor for the streaks.
   :Fog Glow:
      Looks similar to *Ghost*. However, it is much smaller in size
      and gives more of an atmospheric haze or "glow" around the image.

      Size
         Scale of the glow relative to the size of the original bright pixels.
   :Simple Star:
      Works similar to *Streaks* but gives a simpler shape looking like a star.

      Fade
         Fade out factor for the streaks.
      Rotate 45
         Rotate the streaks by 45Â°.

Quality
   If not set to something other the *High*,
   then the glare effect will only be applied to a low resolution copy of the image.
   This can be helpful to save render times while only doing preview renders.

Iterations
   The number of times to run through the filter algorithm.
   Higher values will give more accurate results but will take longer to compute.
   Note that, this is not available for *Fog Glow* as it does not use an iterative-based algorithm.

Color Modulation
   Used for *Streaks* and *Ghosts* to create a special dispersion effect.

   Johannes Itten describes this effect, Color Modulation, as subtle variations in tones and chroma.

Mix
   Value to control how much of the effect is added on to the image.
   A value of -1 would give just the original image, 0 gives a 50/50 mix, and 1 gives just the effect.

Threshold
   Pixels brighter than this value will be affected by the glare filter.
