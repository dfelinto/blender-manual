   :alt: Distance Key Node.

The Distance Key node determines a pixel's alpha value based on the three-dimensional
distance between the image pixel color and the key color in a 3D color space.

This key works well when trying to single out a specific color in a background
(not necessarily green).


Inputs
======

Image
   Standard color input.
Key Color
   The color that is to be keyed.


Properties
==========

Tolerance
   A threshold what the node considers a match between the key color and the foreground pixel.
   The tolerance affects how close a pixel needs to be to the background pixel
   to be considered an absolute match.
Falloff
   When the Falloff value is high, pixels that are close to the Key Color are more
   transparent than pixels that are not as close to the Key Color
   (but still considered close enough to be keyed).
   When the Falloff value is low, it does not matter how close
   the pixel color (Image) is to the Key Color, it is transparent.
Color Space
   It is also possible to work with YCbCr color space,
   but only the Cb and Cr channels are taken into consideration
   for determining the distance between the foreground and background pixels.

   RGB, YCC


Outputs
=======

Image
   The image with an alpha channel adjusted for the keyed selection.
Matte
   A black-and-white alpha mask of the key.
