   :alt: Channel Key Node.

The *Channel Key* node determines background objects from foreground objects by
the difference in the selected channel's levels.

For example in the YUV :term:`Color Model`,
this node is useful when compositing stock footage of explosions (very bright)
which are normally shot against a solid, dark background.


Inputs
======

Image
   Standard color input.


Properties
==========

Color Space
   This button selects what color model the channels will represent.

   RGB, HSV, YUV, YCbCr

Key Channel
   This button selects the channel, defined by the *Color Space*, to use to determine the matte.

Algorithm
   Method to calculate the difference between levels.

   :Max:
      Limit by the maximum of the other two channels other than the *Key Channel*.
   :Single:
      Limit by the maximum of the selected *Limiting Channel*.

      Limiting Channel
         The channel to use when computing the maximum, the options are defined by the *Color Space*.

High
   Determines the lowest values that are considered foreground.
   (Which is supposed to be -- relatively -- high values: from this value to 1.0.)

Low
   Determines the highest values that are considered to be background objects.
   (Which is supposed to be -- relatively -- low values: from 0.0 to this value.)

.. tip::

   It is possible to have a separation between the *High* and *Low* values to allow
   for a gradient of transparency between foreground and background objects.


Outputs
=======

Image
   Image with an alpha channel adjusted for the keyed selection.
Matte
   A black-and-white alpha mask of the key.
