   :alt: Box Mask Node.

The *Box Mask* node creates an image suitable for use as a simple matte.


Inputs
======

Mask
   An optional mask to use as the base for mask operations.
Value
   Intensity of the generated mask.


Properties
==========

X, Y
   Position of the center of the box as a fraction of the total width or height.
   (0.5, 0.5 creates a centered box; 0.0, 0.0 creates a box in the lower left.)
Width
   Width of the box as a fraction of the total image width.
Height
   Height of the box as a fraction of the total image *width*, not height.
Rotation
   Rotation of the box around its center point.
Mask Type
   Operation to use against the input mask.

   :Add:
      This yields the *union* of the input mask and the generated mask:
      Areas covered by the generated mask are set to the specified *Value*.
      Other parts of the input masked are passed through unchanged, or set to black if there is no input mask.
   :Subtract:
      Values of the input mask have the specified *Value* subtracted from them.
   :Multiply:
      This yields the *intersection* of this generated mask and the input mask:
      Values of the input mask are multiplied by the specified *Value* for the area covered by the generated mask.
      All other areas become black.
   :Not:
      Any area covered by both the input mask and the generated mask becomes black.
      Areas covered by the generated mask that are black on the input mask become the specified *Value*.
      Areas uncovered by the generated mask remain unchanged.


Outputs
=======

Mask
   A generated rectangular mask merged with the input mask.
   The created mask is the size of the current scene render dimensions.

.. tip::

   For soft edges, pass the output mask through a slight :doc:`Blur node </compositing/types/filter/blur_node>`.
