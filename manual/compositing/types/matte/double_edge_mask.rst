   Double Edge Mask Node.

The *Double Edge Mask* node creates a gradient between two masks.


Inputs
======

Inner Mask
   A mask representing the inside shape, which will be fully white.
Outer Mask
   A mask representing the outside shape, which will fade from black at its edges
   to white at the *Inner Mask*.


Properties
==========

Inner Edge
   :All:
      All shapes in the *Inner Mask* contribute to the gradient, even ones that do
      not touch the *Outer Mask* shape.
   :Adjacent Only:
      Only shapes in the *Inner Mask* that overlap with the *Outer Mask* contribute
      to the gradient.

             Adjacent Only.

Buffer Edge
   :Keep In:
      Parts of the *Outer Mask* that touch the edge of the image are treated as if
      they stop at the edge.
   :Bleed Out:
      Parts of the *Outer Mask* that touch the edge of the image are extended
      beyond the boundary of the image.
