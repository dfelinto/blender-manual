Properties
==========

Level
   H (Hue), S (Saturation), V (Value)
Curve
   For the curve controls see: :ref:`Curve widget <ui-curve-widget>`.
   By default, the curve is a straight line, meaning there is no change.
   The spectrum allows you to raise or lower HSV levels for each range of pixel colors.
   To change an H, S, or V level, move the curve points up or down. Pixels with hue values each
   point in the horizontal position of the graph will be changed depending on the shape of the curve.


Outputs
=======

Image
   Standard color output.
