(highlights, midtones and shadows) and only affect the necessary RGB channels.

Contrast
   Adjust image contrast.
Gamma
   Exponential gamma correction, affecting the midtones of the image. (Works like Power in the Color Balance node.)
Gain
   Multiplier, stronger influence on the highlights. (Works like Slope in the Color Balance node.)
Lift
   This value (can be negative) will be added (+), linear lightens or darkens the image.
   (Works like *Offset* in the Color Balance node.)


Tonal Ranges (Rows)

Master
   These sliders affect the entire tonal range.

Midtones Start, Midtones End
   Defines the start and the end of midtones range, i.e.
   values where the whole tonal range is divided into the highlights, midtones and shadows
   (there is also a smooth transition between the ranges of width 0.2 units).
