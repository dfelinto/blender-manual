   RGB Curves Node.

The *RGB Curves Node* allows color corrections for each color channel
and levels adjustments in the compositing context.


Inputs
======

Factor
   Controls the amount of influence the node exerts on the output image.
Image
   Standard color input.
Black Level :guilabel:`Compositor Only`
   Defines the input color that is (linear) mapped to black.
White Level :guilabel:`Compositor Only`
   Defines the input color that is (linear) mapped to white.

.. container:: lead

   .. clear

.. tip::

   To define the levels, use the :ref:`eyedropper <ui-eyedropper>` to select a color sample of a displayed image.


Properties
==========

Tone :guilabel:`Compositor Only`
   :Standard: TODO 2.8
   :Film Like: TODO 2.8

Channel
   Clicking on one of the channels displays the curve for each.

   C (Combined RGB), R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue)
Curve
   A BÃ©zier curve that varies the input levels (X axis) to produce an output level (Y axis).
   For the curve controls see: :ref:`Curve widget <ui-curve-widget>`.


Outputs
=======

Image
   Standard color output.


Examples
========

Below are some common curves you can use to achieve desired effects.

   From left to right: 1. Lighten shadows 2. Negative 3. Decrease contrast 4. Posterize.


Color Correction using Curves
-----------------------------

.. figure:: /images/compositing_types_color_rgb-curves_example-rgb.png
   :width: 600px

   Color correction with curves.

In this example, the image has too much red in it,
so we run it through an *RGB Curves* node and reduce the Red channel.

Also, read on for examples of the Darken and Contrast Enhancement curves,
:doc:`here </compositing/types/color/mix>`.


Color Correction using Black/White Levels
-----------------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/compositing_types_color_rgb-curves_black-white-levels.png
   :width: 600px

   Color correction with Black/White Levels.

Manually adjusting the RGB curves for color correction can be difficult.
Another option for color correction is to use the Black and White Levels instead,
which really might be their main purpose.

In this example,
the White Level is set to the color of a bright spot of the sand in the background,
and the Black Level to the color in the center of the fish's eye.
To do this efficiently it is best to bring up the Image Editor showing the original input image.
You can then use the levels' color picker to easily choose
the appropriate colors from the input image, zooming into pixel level if necessary.
The result can be fine-tuned with the R, G, and B curves like in the previous example.

The curve for C is used to compensate for the increased contrast that is a side effect of
setting Black and White Levels.


Effects
-------

   Changing colors by inverting the red channel.
