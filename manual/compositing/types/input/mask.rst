Masks
   The selectable mask data-block. If the label is left blank, the mask name will be set.
Feather
   Use or ignore feather points defined for splines see :ref:`Mask Feathers <mask-feather>` for more details.
Size
   Scene Size will give an image the size of the render resolution for the scene,
   scaling along when rendering with different resolutions. Fixed gives a fixed size in pixels.
   Fixed/Scene gives a size in pixels that still scales along
   when changing the render resolution percentage in the scene.
Motion Blur
   For animated masks, creating a motion blurred mask from the surrounding frames,
   with a given number of samples (higher gives better quality), and a camera shutter time in seconds.
