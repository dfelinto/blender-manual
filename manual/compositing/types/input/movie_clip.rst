   :alt: Movie Clip node.

This node is a special node that uses some of the values taken from
footage cameras and trackings and link them to the output.
It is possible to load image sequences, but only Image and Alpha values
will be available, because the other outputs will not have any values
associated with them.
When a tracked clip is chosen, Blender will fulfill the outputs using
internal values taken from the tracking. So the controls for
start and end frames will be defined in the Movie Clip editor.
