   :alt: Combine Color Node.

The *Combine Color Node* combines an image from its composite color channels.
The node can combine multiple :term:`Color Models <Color Model>` depending on the Mode property.


Inputs
======

The outputs of this node depends on the Mode property (see below).

Alpha
   The color channel that that is responsible for the image's transparency.


Properties
==========

Mode
   The color model to output.

   :RGB: Combine the three inputs: Red, Green, and Blue color channels into a single image.
   :HSV: Combine the three inputs: Hue, Saturation, and Value color channels into a single image.
   :HSL: Combine the three inputs: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness color channels into a single image.
   :YCbCrA:
      Combine the three inputs: Luminance, Chrominance Blue, and Chrominance Red color channels into a single image.

      Color Space
         ITU 601, ITU 709, JPEG
   :YUV: Combine the three inputs: Luminance, U chrominance, and V chrominance color channels into a single image.


Output
======

Image
   Standard image output.


Examples
========

Blur Alpha
----------

   :width: 640px

   An example of blurring the alpha channel.

In this first example, we take the Alpha channel and blur it,
and then combine it back with the colors. When placed in a scene,
the edges of it will blend in, instead of having a hard edge.
This is almost like :term:`Anti-Aliasing` but in a three-dimensional sense.
Use this node setup, when adding CG elements to live action to remove any hard edges.
Animating this effect on a broader scale will make the object appear to "phase" in and out,
as an "out-of-phase" time-traveling sync effect.


Increase Luminance
------------------

.. figure:: /images/compositing_types_converter_math_multiply.png

   An example of the scaling the Luminance channel.

This example has a *Math (Multiply)* node increasing the luminance channel (Y)
of the image to make it brighter.

.. tip::

   If running these channels through a *Color Ramp* node to adjust value,
   use the Cardinal scale for accurate representation.
   Using the Exponential scale on the luminance channel gives a high-contrast effect.
