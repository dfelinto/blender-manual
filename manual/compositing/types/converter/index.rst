  Converter Nodes
###################

As the name implies, these nodes convert the colors or other properties of various data
(e.g. transparency) in some way.

They also split out or re-combine the different color channels that make up an image,
allowing you to work on each channel independently.
Various color channel arrangements are supported, including traditional RGB, HSV
and :abbr:`HDMI (High Definition Media Interface)` formats.
