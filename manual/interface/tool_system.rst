Tool System
***********

Tools are accessed from the :ref:`Toolbar <ui-region-toolbar>`.

This is a general introduction to tools, individual tools have their own documentation.

There can only be one active tool which is stored for each space & mode.

Tools may set their own keys which override other keys
although typically they use the :kbd:`LMB`, sometimes with modifier keys.
*Keymaps can be edited from the preferences.*

Some tools define gizmos (*Shear* and *Spin* for example) to help control the tool.

For tool buttons which have a small triangle in their bottom right corner, a pop-up menu will be revealed
when you :kbd:`LMB` drag so that you can select other tools of the same group.

Hovering your cursor over a tool for a short time will show its name,

Any tool or menu can be added to this pop-up menu via the context menu of buttons and menus.

Pressing :kbd:`Alt` opens a tool prompt, shown in the :doc:`Status Bar </interface/window_system/status_bar>`,
for changing the active tool, pressing :kbd:`Alt` again closes the prompt.

Tools can be changed by pressing the appropriate icon or by pressing :kbd:`Alt`
then pressing the hotkey assigned to the desired tool.


Fallback Tool
-------------

The fallback tool is the default tool in the Toolbar as in the tool at the top of the list.
To switch to this tool use :kbd:`Alt-W` to open a pie menu to choose what the default drag action does.


Cycling Tools
-------------

If you bind a key to a tool which is part of a group, you can enable the *Cycle* option in the keymap editor.
Successive presses will cycle through the tools in that group.


Properties
==========

Tools can have their own settings, which are available from multiple places:

- The :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Tools --> Active Tool` panel.
- The *Active Tool* tab in the Properties.
- The *Tool Settings* region.
