Annotations
***********

The annotation tool is available in multiple editors.
It can be used to add notes to e.g. 3D objects or node setups.
The arrow in the screenshot below is an annotation.

Annotation Tools
================

The annotation tool can be activated in the Toolbar and has the following sub-tools:

.. _tool-annotate-freehand:

Annotate
   Draw free-hand strokes in the main area.

.. _tool-annotate-line:

Annotate Line
   Click and drag to create a line.
   Optionally, you can select the arrow style for the start and end of the line.

.. _tool-annotate-polygon:

Annotate Polygon
   Click multiple times to create multiple connected lines, then press :kbd:`RMB`,
   :kbd:`Return` or :kbd:`Esc` to confirm.

.. _tool-annotate-eraser:

Annotate Eraser
   Click and drag to remove lines.
   The eraser has a *Radius* setting found in :menuselection:`Tool Settings`.


Tool Settings
=============

Common
------

Color
   Adjust the color of existing and new strokes.

Annotation Layer
   A pop-over menu, showing the name of the current layer, to access the `Annotation Layers`_.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.annotation_stroke_placement_view3d:
.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.annotation_stroke_placement_view2d:

Placement
   Determines where the annotations are drawn.

   :3D Cursor:
      Only available in the 3D Viewport. The new annotations become part of the 3D scene;
      they're drawn on an imaginary plane that goes through the :doc:`/editors/3dview/3d_cursor`
      and is aligned to your view.
   :Surface:
      Only available in the 3D Viewport. The new annotations become part of the 3D scene;
      they're drawn onto the surface of the object under the mouse. If there is no surface,
      you get the same behavior as *3D Cursor*.
   :Image:
      Only available in 2D editors such as the :doc:`Image Editor </editors/image/introduction>`.
      The annotations become part of the 2D space, meaning their position and size change as you
      pan and zoom in the editor.
   :View:
      The new annotations are 2D and get stuck to the screen. They keep the same position,
      rotation and size no matter how you pan, orbit or zoom in the editor.

Stabilize Stroke
   Helps to reduce jitter of the strokes while drawing by delaying and correcting the location of points.

   Radius
      Minimum distance from the last point before the stroke continues.
   Factor
      A smooth factor, where higher values result in smoother strokes
      but the drawing sensation feels like as if you were pulling the stroke.


Annotate Line
-------------

Style Start, End
   The decoration to use at the beginning or end of the line segment.
   This can be used for example to create arrows to point out specific details in a scene.


Annotation Layers
=================

When the annotation tool is enabled, the settings for managing multiple layers
can be found in the :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View --> Annotations` panel.

.. _bpy.types.GPencilLayer.annotation_opacity:

Opacity
   Adjusts the opacity of existing and new strokes.

Thickness
   Adjusts the thickness of existing and new strokes.


.. _bpy.types.GPencilLayer.use_annotation_onion_skinning:

Onion Skin
----------

Shows a ghosted image of strokes made in frames before and after the current frame.
Onion skinning only works in the 3D Viewport and Sequencer.
See the Grease Pencil documentation for an explanation of
:doc:`Onion Skinning </grease_pencil/properties/onion_skinning>`.

.. _bpy.types.GPencilLayer.annotation_onion_before_color:
.. _bpy.types.GPencilLayer.annotation_onion_before_range:
.. _bpy.types.GPencilLayer.annotation_onion_after_color:
.. _bpy.types.GPencilLayer.annotation_onion_after_range:

Before/After
   Color to use before and after the current frame on ghost frames.
   The number defines how many frames to show before and after the current frame.
