Color Ramp Widget
*****************

*Color Ramps* specify a color gradient based on color stops. Each stop has a position and a color.
The gradient is then calculated as the interpolation between these stops using the chosen
interpolation method.

   Color ramp.


Controls
========

Add ``+``
   Adds a new stop between the selected stop and the one before it.

Delete ``-``
   Deletes the selected color stop.

Specials ``v``
   Contains more operators for the color ramp.

   Flip Color Ramp
      Flips the gradient, mirroring the positions of the stops.
   Distribute Stops from Left
      Distribute the stops so that every step has the same space to the right.
      This is mostly useful when used with Constant interpolation mode.
   Distribute Stops Evenly
      Distribute the stops so that all neighbors have the same space between them.
   Eyedropper (pipette icon) :kbd:`E`
      An :ref:`ui-eyedropper` to sample a color or gradient from the interface to be used in the color ramp.
   Reset Color Ramp
      Resets the color ramp to its default state.

.. _bpy.types.ColorRamp.color_mode:

Color Mode
   Selection of the :term:`Color Model` used for interpolation.

   :RGB:
      Blends color by mixing each color channel and combining.
   :HSV/HSL:
      Blends colors by first converting to HSV or HSL, mixing, then combining again.
      This has the advantage of maintaining saturation between different hues,
      where RGB would de-saturate. This allows for a richer gradient.

.. _bpy.types.ColorRamp.hue_interpolation:
.. _bpy.types.ColorRamp.interpolation:

Color Interpolation
   The interpolation method to use across the ramp.

   RGB
      :B-Spline: Uses a B-spline interpolation for the color stops.
      :Cardinal: Uses a cardinal interpolation for the color stops.
      :Linear: Uses a linear interpolation for the color stops.
      :Ease: Uses an ease interpolation for the color stops.
      :Constant: Uses a constant interpolation for the color stops.

   HSV/HSL
      :Clockwise: Clockwise interpolation around the HSV/HSL wheel.
      :Counter-Clockwise: Counterclockwise around the HSV/HSL wheel.
      :Near: Nearest route around the wheel.
      :Far: Furthest route around the wheel.

         HSV and HSL interpolation options.

Active Color Stop
   Index of the active color stop (shown as a dashed line).
   Offers an alternative way of selecting a stop in case it's so close to others
   that it's hard to select it directly.

.. _bpy.types.ColorRampElement.position:

Position
   This slider controls the position of the selected color stop in the range.

.. _bpy.types.ColorRampElement.color:

Color
   A :doc:`color field </interface/controls/buttons/fields>` where you can
   specify the color and alpha of the selected stop.


Shortcuts
---------

- :kbd:`LMB` (drag) moves color stops.
- :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` (click) adds a new color stop.
