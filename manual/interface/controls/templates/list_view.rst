   List view with expanded Filtering Options panel.

This control is useful to manage lists of items.
They can be found, for example, in the object data properties.
In addition to the main list, there is a Filtering panel on the bottom
(hidden by default) and modification buttons on the right.

Select
   To select an item, :kbd:`LMB` on it.
Rename
   By double-clicking on an item, you can edit its name via a text field.
   This can also be achieved by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` over it.
Resize
   The list view can be resized to show more or fewer items.
   Hover the mouse over the handle (::::) then click and drag the handle to expand or shrink the list.
Filter
   Click the *Show filtering options* button (triangle on bottom left) to show or hide filter option panel.

   Search :kbd:`Ctrl-F`
      Type part of a list item's name in the filter text field to filter items by part of their name.
   Invert ``<->``
      Toggle between including items that match the search term and those that do not contain the search term.

   Sort by Name
      This button switches between alphabetical and non-alphabetical ordering.
   Reverse
      Sort objects in ascending or descending order. This also applies to alphabetical sorting, if selected.

On the right of the list view are list modification buttons:

Add ``+``
   Adds a new item.
Remove ``-``
   Removes the selected item.
Specials ``v``
   A :ref:`Specials <ui-specials-menu>` menu with operators to edit list entries.
Move (up/down arrow icon)
   Moves the selected item up/down one position.
