   List view with expanded Filtering Options panel.

This control is useful for managing lists of items.
In addition to the main list, there is a Filtering panel on the bottom
(hidden by default) and modification buttons on the right.

Select
   To select an item, click :kbd:`LMB` on it.
Rename
   By double-clicking on an item, you can edit its name via a text field.
   This can also be achieved by clicking it with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`.
Resize
   The list view can be resized to show more or fewer items.
   Hover the mouse over the handle (::::), then click and drag to expand or shrink the list.
Filter
   Click the *Show filtering options* button (triangle on bottom left) to show or hide the filter option panel.

   Search :kbd:`Ctrl-F`
      Filters the list to only show items containing a certain term.
   Invert ``<->``
      Toggle between including items that match the search term and those that do not contain the search term.

   Sort by Name
      This button switches between alphabetical and non-alphabetical ordering.
   Reverse
      Sort objects in ascending or descending order. This also applies to alphabetical sorting, if selected.

On the right of the list view are list modification buttons:

Add ``+``
   Adds a new item.
Remove ``-``
   Removes the selected item.
Specials ``v``
   A :ref:`Specials <ui-specials-menu>` menu with operators to edit list entries.
Move (up/down arrow icon)
   Moves the selected item up/down one position.
