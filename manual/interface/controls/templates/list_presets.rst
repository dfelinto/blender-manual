   List view with expanded Filtering Options panel.

This control is useful to manage lists of items.
They can be found, for example, in the object data properties.
In addition to the main list, there is a Filtering panel on the bottom
(hidden by default) and modification buttons on the right.

   To select an item, :kbd:`LMB` on it.
Rename
   By double-clicking on an item, you can edit its name via a text field.
   This can also be achieved by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` over it.
Resize
   The list view can be resized to show more or fewer items.
   Hover the mouse over the handle (::::) then click and drag the handle to expand or shrink the list.
Filter

   Search :kbd:`Ctrl-F`
      Type part of a list item's name in the filter text field to filter items by part of their name.

      When the magnifying glass icon has a ``+`` sign then only items that match the text will be displayed.
   Filter Exclude
      When the magnifying glass icon has a ``-`` sign then only items that do not match text will be displayed.

   Sort
      Sort list items.

         This button switches between alphabetical and non-alphabetical ordering.
