Auto-Offset
===========

When you drop a node with at least one input and one output socket onto an existing connection between two nodes,
*Auto-offset* will, depending on the direction setting, automatically move the left or right node away to make room
for the new node.
*Auto-offset* is a feature that helps organizing node layouts interactively without interrupting the user workflow.

Auto-offset is enabled by default, but it can be disabled from the editor's header.

You can toggle the offset direction while you are moving the node by pressing :kbd:`T`.

The offset margin can be changed using the *Auto-offset Margin*
setting in the editing section of the Preferences.
