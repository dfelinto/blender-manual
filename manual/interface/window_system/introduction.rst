Window System Introduction
**************************

After starting Blender and closing the :ref:`Splash Screen <splash>`
the Blender window should look something similar to the image below;
as Blender's user interface is consistent across all platforms.

   :align: center

   The default startup Blender window.

Blender's interface is separated into three main parts:

- :doc:`Topbar </interface/window_system/topbar>` at the very top.
- :doc:`Areas </interface/window_system/areas>` in the middle.
- :doc:`Status Bar </interface/window_system/status_bar>` at the bottom.

   Blender's default Screen Layout. Topbar (blue), Areas (green) and Status Bar (red).


Customization
=============

Blender also makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts to speed up work.
These can also be customized in the :ref:`Keymap Editor <prefs-input-keymap-editor>`.


.. rubric:: Theme colors

Blender allows for most of its interface color settings to be changed to suit the needs of the user.
If you find that the colors you see on screen do not match those mentioned
in the Manual then it could be that your default theme has been altered.
Creating a new theme or selecting/altering a pre-existing one can be done by selecting
the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/index>` editor and clicking on the *Themes* tab.
