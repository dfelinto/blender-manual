   :figwidth: 250px

   Area boundaries are indicated by rounded corners (yellow highlights).

The Blender window is divided up into a number of rectangles called Areas.
Areas reserve screen space for :doc:`/editors/index`, such as the 3D Viewport, or the Outliner.
In general an Editor provides a way to view and modify your work through a specific part of Blender.
All hotkeys you press will affect the contents of the Editor in the Area the mouse pointer is located.
Area boundaries are indicated by rounded (beveled) corners.

Areas can be customized to match specific tasks called
:doc:`Workspaces </interface/window_system/workspaces>`,
which can then be named and saved for later use.


Resizing
========

.. figure:: /images/interface_window-system_areas_resize.png
   :align: right
   :width: 250px
   :figwidth: 250px

You can resize areas by dragging their borders with :kbd:`LMB`.
Move your mouse cursor over the border between two areas,
so that the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, and then click and drag.


Splitting
=========

.. figure:: /images/interface_window-system_areas_split.png
   :align: right
   :width: 250px
   :figwidth: 250px

Splitting an area will create a new area. Placing the mouse cursor
in an area corner will change the cursor to a cross (+) to indicate that
pressing down :kbd:`LMB` will activate splitting or joining operator.
Dragging from area corner **inward** will *split* the area.
You define the split direction by dragging either horizontally or vertically.


Joining
=======

.. figure:: /images/interface_window-system_areas_join.png
   :align: right
   :width: 250px
   :figwidth: 250px

   Properties is being joined to the Outliner.

Dragging from an area corner **outward** will *join* two areas.
The area that will be closed shows a dark overlay.
You can select which area will be closed by moving the mouse over areas.
Release the :kbd:`LMB` to complete the join.
If you press :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`RMB` before releasing the mouse,
the operation will be canceled.


Area Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:kbd:`RMB` on the border opens the *Area Options*.

Vertical/Horizontal Split
   Shows an indicator line that lets you select the area and position where to split.
   :kbd:`Tab` switches between vertical/horizontal.
Join Areas
   Shows the join direction overlay.


Swapping Contents
-----------------

You can swap the contents between two areas with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`
on one of the corners of the initial area, dragging towards the target area,
and releasing the mouse there. The two areas do not need to be side-by-side,
though they must be inside the same window.
