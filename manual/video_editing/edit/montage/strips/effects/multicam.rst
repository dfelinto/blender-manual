Multicam Selector Strip
***********************

The Multicam Selector strip is used for multi-camera editing.
Multi-camera editing is when a scene is recorded using multiple cameras from different angles
and then edited together afterwards.


Workflow
========

The process of multi camera editing can be rather easy in the Video Sequencer if properly setup.
The following guide shows the basic steps to setup a basic multi camera editing workflow.

#. First you are going to want to add in each of your video strips.
#. Next, you will want to sync all your cameras by either using
   :doc:`Audio Waveforms </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/sound>` or by the movement of objects.

   .. tip::

      To make syncing strips easier you can group cameras, their audio,
      and their effects together using :doc:`Meta Strips </video_editing/edit/montage/meta>`.

#. Split the editor into many :doc:`Previews </editors/video_sequencer/preview/index>`, one for each input track.
   Then change the :ref:`Display Channel <bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.display_channel>`
   of each of the previews to the channel number of the input track.
#. Add a Multicam Selector strip *above* all the video channel tracks.

   After completing these steps you should get something similar to the following image:

   .. figure:: /images/video-editing_sequencer_strips_effects_multicam_example.png

      Multi-camera editing setup.

#. Now select the Multicam strip, if you take a look at the strip options (in the Sidebar),
   you will notice, that Multicam is a rather simple effect strip:
   It just takes a selected channel as its input. That is all.
   The magic comes with the convenient keyboard layout.
#. When you select the Multicam strip, the keys :kbd:`1` to :kbd:`9` are mapped to the cut buttons.
   So, select the Multicam strip and start playback and press the keys
   for the correct input while watching the individual cameras.
#. You will end up with a small Multicam Selector strip for every cut.

In reality, it boils down to: watch a few seconds to see, what is coming,
watch it again and do a rough cut using the number keys.
Then fine-tune the placement by selecting the outer handles of two neighboring Multicam for A/B rolling.

.. tip::

   To improve playback performance enable :doc:`Proxies </editors/video_sequencer/sequencer/sidebar/proxy>`.


Options
