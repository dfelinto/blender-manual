Transform
=========

.. _bpy.ops.transform.seq_slide:

Move
----

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Move`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`G`

Pressing :kbd:`G` moves all the selected strip(s).
Move your mouse horizontally (left/right) to change the strip's position in time.
Move vertically (up/down) to change channels.

Holding down :kbd:`Ctrl` while dragging snaps to the start and endpoints of other strips.
The position of the mouse relative to the selection influences where the strips are snapped.
If it is closer to the start of the selection, then the start frame of the selection gets snapped,
else the end frame will get snapped.

To "ripple edit" (make room for strips you drag) hold :kbd:`Alt` when placing a strip.

You can also lock the direction to time with :kbd:`X` or to change the strip's channel with :kbd:`Y`.

It is possible to move strips using mouse by dragging them while holding :kbd:`LMB`.
Currently it is possible to move only one strip by dragging.


Start Frame Offset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Start Frame Offset* for that strip can be selected by clicking :kbd:`LMB` on the left handle of the strip;
holding it down (or pressing :kbd:`G` and then moving the mouse left/right)
changes the start frame within the strip by the number of frames you move it.
The frame number label under the strip displays the start frame of the strip.

- If you have a 20-image sequence strip, and drag the left handle to the right by 10 frames,
  the strip will start at image 11 (images 1 to 10 will be skipped).
  Use this to clip off a roll-up or undesired lead-in.
- Dragging the left handle left will create a lead-in (copies) of the first frame for as many frames as you drag it.
  Use this when you want some frames for a transition at the start of the clip.


End Frame
^^^^^^^^^

The *End Frame* of the strip could be selected by clicking :kbd:`LMB` on the right handle of the strip;
holding it down (or pressing :kbd:`G`) and then moving the mouse changes the ending frame within the strip.
The frame number label over the strip displays the end frame of the strip.

- Dragging the right handle to the left shortens the clip;
  any original images at the tail are ignored. Use this to quickly clip off a roll-down.
- Dragging the right handle to the right extends the clip.
  For movies and images sequences, more of the animation is used until exhausted.
  Extending a clip beyond its length will render as a copy of the last image.
  Use this for transitions out of this clip.

.. note:: Multiple selection

   You can select several (handles of) strips by :kbd:`Shift-LMB` clicking: when you press :kbd:`G`,
   everything that is selected will move with your mouse -- this means that,
   for example, you can at the same time move a strip, shorten two others, and extend a forth one.


Move/Extend from Current Frame
------------------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Move/Extend from Current Frame`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`E`

With a number of strips selected, pressing :kbd:`E` lets you interactively extend the strips.
This is similar to moving but is useful for extending (or shortening) time around the current frame.

All selected strip handles to the "mouse side" of the current frame indicator will transform together,
so you can change the duration of the current frame.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.slip:

Slip Strip Contents
-------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Slip Strip Contents`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`S`

The Slip tool allows you to change the position of the contents of a strip without moving the strip itself.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.snap:

Snap Strips to the Current Frame
--------------------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Snap Strips to the Current Frame`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-S`

Moves the strip or control point to the current frame.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.offset_clear:

Clear Strips Offset
-------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Clear Strips Offset`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-O`

To reset the (soft) start/end frame handles.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.swap:

Swap Strips
-----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Swap Strips`

Left :kbd:`Alt-Left`
   Swaps the active strip with the strip to the left.
Right :kbd:`Alt-Right`
   Swaps the active strip with the strip to the right.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.gap_remove:

Remove Gaps
-----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Insert Gaps`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Backspace`

Remove blank frames between the current frame and the first strip to the left,
independent of selection or locked state of strips.

All Gaps
   Remove gaps to the right of the strip along with the left.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.gap_insert:

Insert Gaps
-----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Insert Gaps`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Equals`

Insert blank frames between the current frame and the first strips to the right,
independent of selection or locked state of strips.


Image Transform
===============

.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.strip_transform_fit:

Scale to Fit
------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Scale to Fit`

Adjusts the strips :ref:`Scale Transforms <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.scale>`
so the visual contents of the strip to fit exactly within the project's :doc:`/render/output/properties/dimensions`
while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

This may mean that the transparent areas may be added
along the content's border to fit the content in the rendered area.


Scale to Fill
-------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Scale to Fill`

Adjusts the strips :ref:`Scale Transforms <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.scale>`
so the visual contents of the strip to span the project's :doc:`/render/output/properties/dimensions`
while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

This may mean that portions of the original image no longer fit the content inside the rendered area.


Stretch to Fill
---------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Stretch to Fill`

Adjusts the strips :ref:`Scale Transforms <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.scale>`
so the visual contents of the strip to fill the project's :doc:`/render/output/properties/dimensions`.
Note, unlike the other two methods described above, *Stretch to Fill* does not maintaining the original aspect ratio.

This may mean that the original image becomes distorted to fit the content inside the rendered area.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.strip_transform_clear:

Clear Position
--------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Clear Position`

Resets the strips :ref:`Position Transforms <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.rotation>` to a value of zero.


Clear Scale
-----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Clear Scale`

Resets the strips :ref:`Scale Transforms <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.scale>` to a value of one.


Clear Rotation
--------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Clear Rotation`

Resets the strips :ref:`Rotation Transform <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.rotation>` to a value of zero.


Clear All
---------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Image Transform --> Clear All`

Resets the strips position, scale, and rotation :ref:`Transforms <bpy.types.SequenceTransform>` to
their default values.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.split:

Split
=====

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Split`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`K`

This splits the selected strip in two at the current frame.
This will result in two strips which use the same source, fitting the original strip's timing and length.

.. hint::

   This can be thought of as a quick way to duplicate the current strip,
   adjusting the start/end frames to form two non-overlapping strips showing the same content as before.


Hold Split
==========

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Hold Split`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-K`

Like *Split*, it splits a strip in two distinct strips;
however you will not be able to drag the endpoints to show the frames past the split of each resulting strip.

Although you can adjust the :ref:`Hold Offset <sequencer-duration-hard>`
number fields in the *Strip Info* panel.

.. hint::

   This can be thought of as a way to simulate splitting the video file in two parts at the cut-point,
   replacing the current strip with each.


.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.duplicate_move:

Duplicate Strips
================

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Duplicate Strips`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-D`
