*****************
Gamma Cross Strip
*****************

The Gamma Cross transition is similar to the :doc:`/video_editing/sequencer/strips/transitions/cross` transition,
however, the Gamma Cross strip transition uses color correction while transitioning between the two strips,
resulting in a smoother transition that is easier on the eyes.


Options
=======

Default Fade
   Automatically calculates a linear fade over the length of the strip.

   Effect Fader
      Allows you to manually :doc:`keyframe </animation/keyframes/index>` a custom fade.
      This can be used with different :ref:`easings <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-easing>`
      to fine-tune the fade in/out.
