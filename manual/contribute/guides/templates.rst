The following guide provides patterns for interface elements and directories.


Operator Menus
==============

Each operator should receive its own heading or page based on the length of the content.
At the start should be a reference admonition documenting the context of the operator::

   .. admonition:: Reference
      :class: refbox

      :Mode:      Edit Mode
      :Menu:      :menuselection:`Curve --> Snap`
      :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-S`


Panels
======

Panels should be documented by their own heading, nested panels should use decreasing heading levels.
Each panel could have its own page based on the length of documentation and/or the amount of panels.
Expanded menus that toggle what properties are presented to the user should be treated like subpanels::

   Panel Title
   ===========

   Nested Panel Title
   ------------------


Properties
==========

Properties should be documented using definition lists.
Properties that are hidden based on other properties should used nested definitions::

   Property
      Property description.

      Hidden Property
         Hidden property description.

Select menus should be documented using the following syntax::

   Menu Label
      General description of the menu.

      :Menu Item: Menu Item Definition.
      :Menu Item: Menu Item Definition.
      :Menu Item: Menu Item Definition.


Nodes
=====

Nodes should always have three headings inputs, properties and outputs
with a note of absence if the node has none.
At the end of the page can be an optional example(s) section::

   **********
   World Node
   **********

   .. figure:: /images/render_shader-nodes_output_world_node.png
      :align: right

      The World node.

   Introduction and general use case(s).


   Inputs
   ======

   This node has no inputs.


   Properties
   ==========

   This node has no properties.


   Outputs
   =======

   This node has no outputs.


   Example

Directory Layout
================

Sections should be generally structured as follows:

- ``directory_name/``

  - ``index.rst`` (contains links to internal files)
  - ``introduction.rst``
  - ``section_1.rst``
  - ``section_2.rst``

For example:

- ``rendering/``

  - ``index.rst``
  - ``cycles/``

    - ``index.rst``
    - ``introduction.rst``
    - ``materials/``

      - ``index.rst``
      - ``introduction.rst``
      - ``volumes.rst``

The idea is to enclose all the content of a section inside of a folder. Ideally every section
should have an ``index.rst`` (containing the TOC for that section) and an ``introduction.rst``
(introducing) to the contents of the section.


Table of Contents
-----------------

By default, a table of contents should show two levels of depth::

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2

      introduction.rst
      perspective.rst
      depth_of_field.rst
