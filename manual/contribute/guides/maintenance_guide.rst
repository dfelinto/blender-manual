Adding/Removing/Moving Files
============================

When RST-files are added or removed the corresponding locale files
are added or removed automatically by the update script.
However, if files need to be moved please use this Python script::

   python tools_rst/rst_remap.py start

RST-files can then be freely moved and the remap script will move the locale file after::

   python tools_rst/rst_remap.py finish

It is best to avoid moving/renaming files as this breaks URLs and
without this script translators will lose all their work in these files.
Please ask an administrator if you think something should be renamed/moved.

.. note::

   This script also works for image file names.
