Quick Start
===========

Open a terminal, then go to the directory where Blender is installed,
and run Blender like this:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd <blender installation directory>
   ./blender

If you have Blender installed in your ``PATH``
(usually when Blender is installed through a distribution package), you can simply run:

.. code-block:: sh

   blender


Details
=======

Depending on your desktop environment setup, a Blender icon may appear on your desktop or
an entry for Blender is added to your menu after you install Blender.

Many desktop environments support the ability to "Run in terminal".
