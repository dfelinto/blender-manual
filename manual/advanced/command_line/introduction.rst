Introduction

The *Console Window*, also called a *Terminal*, is an operating system text window that displays
messages about Blender's operations, status, and internal errors.

When Blender is manually started from a terminal,
Blender output is shown in the *Console Window* it is started from.

Use Cases:

- For :ref:`rendering animation <command_line-render>`.
- For automation and batch processing which require launching Blender
  with different :doc:`arguments </advanced/command_line/arguments>`.
- For Python development, to see the output of the ``print()`` function.
- If Blender exits unexpectedly, the messages may indicate the cause or error.
- When troubleshooting, to see the output of ``--debug`` messages.

See: :ref:`command_line-launch-index`
for specific instructions on launching Blender from the command line.

.. tip:: Closing the Blender Console Window

   Closing the *Console Window* will also close Blender, losing any unsaved work.
