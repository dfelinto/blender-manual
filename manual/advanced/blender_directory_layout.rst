**************************
Blender's Directory Layout
**************************

This page documents the different directories used by Blender
*(which can be helpful for troubleshooting)*.

There are three different directories Blender may use,
their exact locations are platform dependent.

:LOCAL:
   Location of configuration and run-time data (for self-contained bundle).
:USER:
   Location of configuration files (typically in the user's home directory).
:SYSTEM:
   Location of run-time data for system wide installation (may be read-only).

For system installations both **SYSTEM** and **USER** directories are needed.

For locally extracted Blender distributions, the user configuration and run-time data are
kept in the same subdirectory, allowing multiple Blender versions to run without conflict,
ignoring the **USER** and **SYSTEM** files.
This requires you to create a folder named ``config`` in the **LOCAL** directory.


Platform Dependent Paths
========================

Here are the default locations for each system:


Linux
-----

:LOCAL:
   .. parsed-literal:: ./|BLENDER_VERSION|/
:USER:
   .. parsed-literal:: $HOME/.config/blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/
:SYSTEM:
   .. parsed-literal:: /usr/share/blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/

.. note::

   The path |INSTALLDIR| is relative to the Blender executable and
   is used for self-contained bundles distributed by official blender.org builds.

.. |INSTALLDIR| replace:: ./|BLENDER_VERSION|/

.. note::

   The **USER** path will use ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` if it is set:

   .. parsed-literal:: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/


macOS
-----

:LOCAL:
   .. parsed-literal:: ./|BLENDER_VERSION|/
:USER:
   .. parsed-literal:: /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/
:SYSTEM:
   .. parsed-literal:: /Library/Application Support/Blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/

.. note::

   macOS stores the Blender binary in ``./Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender``.
   The local path to data and config is:

   .. parsed-literal:: ./Blender.app/Contents/Resources/|BLENDER_VERSION|/


Windows
-------

:LOCAL:
   .. parsed-literal:: .\\\ |BLENDER_VERSION|\\
:USER:
   .. parsed-literal:: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\\ |BLENDER_VERSION|\\
:SYSTEM:
   .. parsed-literal:: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\\ |BLENDER_VERSION|\\

.. note::

   For installations from the Window's Store, the ``USER`` and ``SYSTEM``
   directories are inside a special folder resembling:
   ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\BlenderFoundation.Blender<HASH>\LocalCache\Roaming\Blender 
   Foundation\Blender``
   where "HASH" is a string specific to each installation.


Path Layout
===========

This is the path layout which is used within the directories described above.

Where ``./config/startup.blend`` could be ``~/.blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/config/startup.blend`` for example.

``./autosave/ ...``
   Autosave blend-file location. (Windows only, temp directory used for other systems.)

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER``.

``./config/ ...``
   Defaults & session info.

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER``.

``./config/startup.blend``
   Default file to load on startup.

``./config/userpref.blend``
   Default preferences to load on startup.

``./config/bookmarks.txt``
   File Browser bookmarks.

``./config/recent-files.txt``
   Recent file menu list.

``./datafiles/ ...``
   Runtime files.

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER, SYSTEM``.

``./datafiles/locale/{language}/``
   Static precompiled language files for UI translation.

``./scripts/ ...``
   Python scripts for the user interface and tools.

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER, SYSTEM``.

``./scripts/addons/*.py``
   Python add-ons which may be enabled in the Preferences include import/export format support,
   render engine integration and many handy utilities.

``./scripts/addons/modules/*.py``
   Modules for add-ons to use
   (added to Python's ``sys.path``).

``./scripts/addons_contrib/*.py``
   Another add-ons directory which is used for community maintained add-ons (must be manually created).

``./scripts/addons_contrib/modules/*.py``
   Modules for ``addons_contrib`` to use
   (added to Python's ``sys.path``).

``./scripts/modules/*.py``
   Python modules containing our core API and utility functions for other scripts to import
   (added to Python's ``sys.path``).

``./scripts/startup/*.py``
   Scripts which are automatically imported on startup.

``./scripts/presets/{preset}/*.py``
   Presets used for storing user-defined settings for cloth, render formats, etc.

``./scripts/templates_py/*.py``
   Example scripts which can be accessed from :menuselection:`Text Editor --> Templates --> Python`.

``./scripts/templates_osl/*.osl``
   Example OSL shaders which can be accessed from
   :menuselection:`Text Editor --> Templates --> Open Shading Language`.

``./python/ ...``
   Bundled Python distribution.

   Search order: ``LOCAL, SYSTEM``.


.. _local-cache-dir:

Local Cache Directory
=====================

The cache directory is used to store persistent chaches locally. Currently it is only used for the indexing of
:ref:`Asset Libraries <what-is-asset-library>`. The operating system is not expected to clear this automatically.

The following path will be used:

- :Linux: ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/blender/`` if ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME`` is set, otherwise ``$HOME/.cache/blender/``
- :macOS: ``/Library/Chaches/Blender/``
- :Windows: ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Blender Foundation\Blender\Cache\``


.. _temp-dir:

Temporary Directory
===================

The temporary directory is used to store various files at run-time
(including render layers, physics cache, copy-paste buffer and crash logs).

The temporary directory is selected based on the following priority:

- User Preference (see :ref:`prefs-file-paths`).
- Environment variables (``TEMP`` on Windows, ``TMP`` & ``TMP_DIR`` on other platforms).
- The ``/tmp/`` directory.


Overriding Default Directories
==============================

It's possible to override the default **USER** and **SYSTEM** directories using environment variables.

While this shouldn't be needed for typical usage, some specialized use cases may take advantage of this, such as:

- Using a shared network drives for specific paths.
- Isolating an instance from the default user files to prevent automated tasks from accessing user configuration.

See :ref:`command-line-args-environment-variables` for details.
