Application Templates
*********************

Usage
=====

Application templates are a feature that allows you to define a re-usable configuration
that can be selected to replace the default configuration,
without requiring a separate Blender installation or overwriting your personal settings.

Application templates can be selected from the splash screen or :menuselection:`File --> New` submenu.
When there are no templates found the menu will not be displayed on the splash screen.

New application templates can be installed from the :ref:`topbar-app_menu`.
If you would like to keep the current application template active on restarting Blender, save your preferences.


Motivation
----------

In some cases it's not enough to write a single script or add-on,
and expect someone to replace their preferences and startup file, install scripts and change their keymap.

The goal of application templates is to support switching to a customized configuration
without disrupting your existing settings and installation.
This means people can build their own *applications* on top of Blender that can be easily distributed.


Details
-------

An application template may define its own:

Startup File
   The default file to load with this template.
Preferences
   Only certain preferences from a template are used:

   - Themes.
   - Add-ons.
   - Keymaps.
   - Viewport lighting.
Splash Screen
   Templates may provide their own splash screen image.
Python Scripts
   While templates have access to the same functionality as any other scripts,
   typical operations include:

   - Modifying and replacing parts of the user interface.
   - Defining new menus, keymaps and tools.
   - Defining a custom add-on path for template specific add-ons.

Templates also have their own user configuration, so saving a startup file while using a template
won't overwrite your default startup file.


Directory Layout
----------------

Templates may be located in one of two locations within the ``scripts`` directory.

Template locations:
   | ``{BLENDER_USER_SCRIPTS}/startup/bl_app_templates_user``
   | ``{BLENDER_SYSTEM_SCRIPTS}/startup/bl_app_templates_system``

User configuration is stored in a subdirectory:

Without a template:
   | ``./config/startup.blend``
   | ``./config/userpref.blend``
With a template:
   | ``./config/{APP_TEMPLATE_ID}/startup.blend``
   | ``./config/{APP_TEMPLATE_ID}/userpref.blend``

See :ref:`blender-directory-layout` for details on script and configuration locations.

.. hint:: Troubleshooting Paths

   When creating a application template, you may run into issues where paths are not being found.
   To investigate this you can log output of all of Blender's path look-ups.

   Example command line arguments that load Blender with a custom application template
   (replace ``my_app_template`` with the name of your own template):

   .. code-block:: sh

      blender --log "bke.appdir.*" --log-level -1 --app-template my_app_template

   You can then check the paths where attemps to access ``my_app_template`` are made.


Command Line Access
-------------------

Using the :ref:`command-line arguments <command_line-args>` you can setup a launcher
that opens Blender with a specific app template:

.. code-block:: sh

   blender --app-template my_template


Template Contents
=================

Each of the following files can be used for application templates but are optional.

``startup.blend``
   Factory startup file to use for this template.
``userpref.blend``
   Factory preferences file to use for this template.
   When omitted preferences are shared with the default Blender configuration.

   *(As noted previously, this is only used for a subset of preferences).*

``splash.png``
   Splash screen to override Blender's default artwork (not including header text).
   Note, this image must be a ``1000x500`` image.

``__init__.py``
   A Python script which must contain ``register`` and ``unregister`` functions.

.. note::

   Bundled blend-files ``startup.blend`` and ``userpref.blend`` are considered *Factory Settings*
   and are never overwritten.

   The user may save their own startup/preferences while using this template which will be stored
   in their user configuration, but only when the template includes its own ``userpref.blend`` file.

   The original template settings can be loaded using: *Load Template Factory Settings*
   from the file menu in much the same way *Load Factory Settings* works.


Template Scripts
================

While app templates can use Python scripts,
they simply have access to the same APIs available for add-ons and any other scripts.

As noted above, you may optionally have an ``__init__.py`` in your app template.
This has the following advantages:

- Changes can be made to the startup or preferences, without having to distribute a blend-file.
- Changes can be made dynamically.

  You could for example -- configure the template to check the number of processors,
  operating system and memory, then set values based on this.

- You may enable add-ons associated with your template.

On activation a ``register`` function is called, ``unregister`` is called when another template is selected.

As these only run once, any changes to defaults must be made via handler.
Two handlers you're likely to use are:

- ``bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_preferences_post``
- ``bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_startup_post``

These allow you to define your own "factory settings", which the user may change,
just as Blender has it's own defaults when first launched.

This is an example ``__init__.py`` file which defines defaults for an app template to use.

.. code-block:: python

   import bpy
   from bpy.app.handlers import persistent

   @persistent
   def load_handler_for_preferences(_):
       print("Changing Preference Defaults!")
       from bpy import context

       prefs = context.preferences
       prefs.use_preferences_save = False

       kc = context.window_manager.keyconfigs["blender"]
       kc_prefs = kc.preferences
       if kc_prefs is not None:
           kc_prefs.select_mouse = 'RIGHT'
           kc_prefs.spacebar_action = 'SEARCH'
           kc_prefs.use_pie_click_drag = True

       view = prefs.view
       view.header_align = 'BOTTOM'


   @persistent
   def load_handler_for_startup(_):
       print("Changing Startup Defaults!")

       # Use smooth faces.
       for mesh in bpy.data.meshes:
           for poly in mesh.polygons:
               poly.use_smooth = True

       # Use material preview shading.
       for screen in bpy.data.screens:
           for area in screen.areas:
               for space in area.spaces:
                   if space.type == 'VIEW_3D':
                       space.shading.type = 'MATERIAL'
                       space.shading.use_scene_lights = True


   def register():
       print("Registering to Change Defaults")
       bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_preferences_post.append(load_handler_for_preferences)
       bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_startup_post.append(load_handler_for_startup)

   def unregister():
       print("Unregistering to Change Defaults")
       bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_preferences_post.remove(load_handler_for_preferences)
       bpy.app.handlers.load_factory_startup_post.remove(load_handler_for_startup)
