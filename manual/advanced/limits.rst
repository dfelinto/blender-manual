Space
=====

While object positions, vertex locations are not clamped, larger values become increasingly imprecise.
To get an idea of the precision you can work with using different scales.
Here's a table of scales and their associated accuracy:

.. # Python script used to generate the values below
   import ctypes
   from sys import platform as _platform
   _libm = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('libm.so.6')
   _funcname_f = 'nextafterf'
   _nextafterf = getattr(_libm, _funcname_f)
   _nextafterf.restype = ctypes.c_float
   _nextafterf.argtypes = [ctypes.c_float, ctypes.c_float]
   i = 10
   while i < 10000000:
      delta = _nextafterf(i, i + 1) - i
      print(":{scale:,}: 1/{div:,}\\ :sup:`th`".format(scale=i, div=int(1 / delta)))
      i = i * 10


:10: 1/1,048,576\ :sup:`th`
:100: 1/131,072\ :sup:`th`
:1,000: 1/16,384\ :sup:`th`
:10,000: 1/1,024\ :sup:`th`
:100,000: 1/128\ :sup:`th`
:1,000,000: 1/16\ :sup:`th`

.. hint::

   For a rough rule of thumb, values within -5,000/+5,000 are typically reliable (range of 10,000).
   Internally *single precision* floating point calculations are used.


Time
====

.. # Python script used to generate the values below
   from datetime import timedelta
   maxframe = 1048574
   for fps in (24, 25, 30, 60):
      seconds = maxframe / fps
      print(":%d fps: %d hours, %d minutes." %
            (fps, seconds // 3600, seconds % 3600 // 60))

The maximum number of frames for each scene is currently 1,048,574, and allows for continuous shots for durations of:

:24 fps: 12 hours, 8 minutes.
:25 fps: 11 hours, 39 minutes.
:30 fps: 9 hours, 42 minutes.
:60 fps: 4 hours, 51 minutes.

.. note::

   In practice, a finished work is typically composed of output from many scenes.
   So this limit does not prevent you from creating longer works.


Text Fields
===========

Fixed strings are used internally, and while it is not useful to list all limits, here are some common limits.
*Used for data-block names, modifiers, vertex groups, UV layers...*

:directory: 767
:file-name: 255
:file-path: 1023
:identifier: 63

.. note::

   Multi-byte encoding means some Unicode characters use more than a single ASCII character.
