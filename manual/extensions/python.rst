Blender 2.6, Python Manual
**************************

Introduction
============

Welcome to the Blender 2.6 Python Manual.


Python `www.Python.org <http://www.python.org/>`__ is an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing,
very high level dynamic data types, and classes.
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.


Python scripts are a powerful and versatile way to extend Blender functionality.
Most areas of Blender can be scripted, including Animation, Rendering, Import and Export,
Object Creation and the scripting of repetitive tasks.


To interact with Blender, scripts can make use of the tightly integrated API
(Application Programming Interface).


General information
*******************

Links that are useful while writing scripts.

- `Blender Python API <http://www.blender.org/documentation/250PythonDoc/>`__
  - Official API documentation. Use this for referencing while writing scripts.
-

FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: dev;
[[Dev:2.5/Py/API/Intro|API introduction]]
)

  - A short introduction to get you started with the API. Contains examples.
-

FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: dev;
[[Dev:2.5/Py/Scripts/Cookbook|CookBook]]
)

  - A section of handy code snippets (yet to be written)
- :doc:`FAQ </extensions/python/faq>`
  - Frequently asked questions and their answers

Links that deal with distributing your scripts.

-

FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: dev;
[[Dev:Py/Sharing|Sharing scripts]]
)

  - Information on how to share your scripts and get them included in the official Blender distribution.
-
