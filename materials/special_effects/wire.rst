The Wire Render option in the Materials section provides a way of showing a rendered image of
the edges in an object.
Each edge is rendered as a single-pixel image of the edges which make up the mesh. The colors,
alpha and other relevant properties of the lines are selected with the same control panels as
provided by the Surface rendered image.
