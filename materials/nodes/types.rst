Types of Material Nodes
=======================

This section is organized by type of node, which are grouped based on similar functions:


- :doc:`Input <materials/nodes/types/input>` - Introduces a material or component to the node map.
- :doc:`Output <materials/nodes/types/output>` - Displays the result in progress as a small image.
- :doc:`Color <materials/nodes/types/color>`\ - Manipulates the colors of the material.
- :doc:`Vector <materials/nodes/types/vector>`\ - Change the way light is reflected off the material.
- :doc:`Convertors <materials/nodes/types/convertor>`\ - Convert colors to other material colors.
- :doc:`Groups <materials/nodes/node_groups>`\ - User-defined groups of nodes.
- :doc:`Dynamic <materials/nodes/types/dynamic>`\ - Custom nodes defined by Python. These are also known as PyNodes.
