   Panel Physics in Material context


This panel contains physical properties that control how the object surfaces that use the
material are rendered in real time by the Blender Game Engine.

Physics settings are visible when using the game engine for rendering. Game physics usage is described :doc:`Here <game_engine/physics>`

**Friction**
   Coulomb friction coefficient when inside the physics distance area.

**Elasticity**
   Elasticity of collisions.

**Force Field**
   Controls force field settings.
   **Force**
      Upward spring force when inside the physics distance area.
   **Distance**
      Distance of physics area.
   **Damping**
      Damping of the spring force when inside the physics distance area.
   **Align to Normal**
      Align dynamic game objects along the surface normal when inside the physics distance area.
