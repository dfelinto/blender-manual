   Common Actuator Options


All actuators have a set of common buttons, fields and menus. They are organized as follows:


**Triangle button**
    Collapses the sensor information to a single line (toggle).
**Actuator type** menu
    Specifies the type of the sensor.
**Actuator name**
    The name of the actuator. This can be selected by the user. It is used to access actuators with python; it needs to be unique among the selected objects.
:kbd:`X` **Button**
    Deletes the actuator.
