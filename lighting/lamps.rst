Lamps
=====

Blender comes equipped with five different lamp types,
each with its own unique strengths and limitations. Here are the available lamps:

- :doc:`Point <lighting/lamps/lamp>` is an omni-directional point light source, similar to a light bulb.
- :doc:`Spot <lighting/lamps/spot>` is a directional point light source, similar to … a spot.
- :doc:`Area <lighting/lamps/area>` is a source simulating an area which is producing light, as windows, neons, TV screens.
- :doc:`Hemi <lighting/lamps/hemi>` simulates a very wide and far away light source, like the sky.
- :doc:`Sun <lighting/lamps/sun>` simulates a very far away and punctual light source, like the sun.

You can add new lamps to a scene using the :guilabel:`Add` menu in the top header, or with
(\ :menuselection:`[Shift][A] --> Add --> Lamp`\ ).

Once added, a lamp's position is indicated in the 3D View by a solid dot in a circle, but most
types also feature dashed wire-frames that help describe their orientation and properties.
While each type is represented differently,
there are some visual indicators common to all of them:
:guilabel:`Shadows`
   If shadows are enabled, an additional dashed circle is drawn around the solid circle. This makes it easier to quickly determine if a lamp has shadows enabled.

:guilabel:`Vertical Height Marker`
   This is a dim gray line, which helps locate the lamp's position relative to the global X-Y plane.
