   Shadow panel


The :guilabel:`Spot` light source can only cast raytraced shadows.
It shares with other lamp types the same common shadowing options,
described in :doc:`Shadows Properties <lighting/shadows/properties>`.

The raytraced shadows settings of this lamp are shared with other ones,
and are described in :doc:`Raytraced Properties <lighting/shadows/raytraced_properties>`.

   Spotlights can use either raytraced shadows or
   [[Doc:2.5/Manual/Lighting/Lamps/Spot/Buffered Shadows|buffered shadows]].
   Either of the two can provide various extra options. Raytraced shadows are generally more accurate,
   with extra capabilities such as transparent shadows, although they are quite slower to render.
   Buffered shadows are more complex to set up and involve more faking,
   but the speed of rendering is a definite advantage.
   Nevertheless, it shares with other lamp types common shadows options described in
   [[Doc:2.5/Manual/Lighting/Shadows/Properties|Shadows Properties]].

   The raytraced shadows settings of this lamp are shared with other ones, and are described in [[Doc:2.5/Manual/Lighting/Shadows/Raytraced Properties|Raytraced Properties]].
