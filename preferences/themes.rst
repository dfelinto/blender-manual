Customizing themes
==================


As has been said previously, Blender is very customizable—some of the settings affect
interface appearance and colors. These are set under the :guilabel:`Themes` tab.

The colors for each editor can be set separately—simply select the editor you wish to
change in the multi-choice list at the left, and adjust colors as required.
Notice that changes appear in real-time on your screen. In addition, details such as the dot
size in the :guilabel:`3D View` or the :guilabel:`Graph Editor` can also be changed.

Themes use blenders preset system,
you can save a theme to an XML and install it on another system.
