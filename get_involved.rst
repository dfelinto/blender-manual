About
=====

Blender's official documentation can be found in the online
`Blender Manual <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/>`__.
The Blender Manual is written using reStructuredText (RST) and
is built with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__.

This project is run by a small team of volunteers and we would love your contributions!
