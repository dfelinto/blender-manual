to organize and write our complete and freely available end-user documentation.

Volunteers interested in documentation translations can contact the team as well.

About
=====

Blender's official documentation can be found in the online
`Blender Manual <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/>`__.
The Blender Manual is written using reStructuredText (RST) and

This project is run by a small team of volunteers and we would love your contributions!
