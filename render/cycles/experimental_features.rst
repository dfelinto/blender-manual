Experimental Features
=====================

Some features in Cycles are not finished yet, but already included in builds for testing.
These features may not work, crash Blender or change behavior in later versions.

They are hidden by default, but can be enabled by setting :guilabel:`Feature Set` to
:guilabel:`Experimental` in the Render properties.
