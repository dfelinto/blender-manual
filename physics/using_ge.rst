Converting Game Engine Physics
==============================

Sometimes, you may want to animate a wall being broken down by an object,
or a bunch of objects collapsing, falling, or bouncing with accurate physics. You could
manually insert keyframes and do trial and error adjusting with F-Curves to simulate physics
and acceleration, or, you can do it much easier and automatically by taking advantage of
Blender Game Engine Physics. Blender now has a feature which allows you to record animation in
a blender game and turn it into Blender Animation Keyframes.

Animation can be recorded by going Game>Record Animation.
The animation can them to recorded with :kbd:`Alt`\ +\ :kbd:`A`

   A Pile


If you just want a static pile of stuff, you can move to the last frame,
and delete all the keyframes quickly by turning them into NLAs and deleting.
