Collisions
==========

Smoke can collide with mesh objects, using the 'Collision' option in smoke.
Currently only static collision objects are supported.


Forces
------

Blender's force fields (such as wind or vortex fields) are also supported,
modifying the smoke simulation as they do for other physics systems such as particles.
