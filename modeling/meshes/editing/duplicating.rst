Mesh Duplicating Tools
======================

This section covers mesh editing tools that add additional geometry by duplicating existing
geometry in some way.

   :class: note

   When you use one of the duplication tools in the :guilabel:`Mesh Tools` panel, Blender cannot guess which view you want to work in - if you have more than one opened, of course… As the view is often important for these tools, once you have activated one, your cursor turns into a sort of question mark - click with it inside the window you want to use.
