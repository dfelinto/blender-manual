Window Types
============

   The Window Type selection menu.


The :guilabel:`Blender` interface is divided up into many rectangular :guilabel:`Window
Frames`\ . Each :guilabel:`Window Frame` may contain different types of information,
depending upon the :guilabel:`Window Type`\ .

Each :guilabel:`Window Frame` operates independently of the others,
and you can have the same :guilabel:`Window Type` in many frames. For example, you may have
several :guilabel:`3D windows` open but each looking at the :guilabel:`Scene` from a different
perspective. You can split and merge and resize :guilabel:`Window Frames` to suit whatever you
are working on. You can also arrange some :guilabel:`Window Frames` to display without a
:guilabel:`Header` to save screen space.

:guilabel:`Window Types` are broken up by functionality:


- :doc:`The 3D View <3d_interaction/navigating>`\ - Show a graphical view of your scene.
- :doc:`The Timeline <animation/timeline>` - Control animation playback.
-
