   Shelves in a 3D Window


Panels generally appear in the :guilabel:`Properties Window` (Buttons Window in Version 2.4x),
which can be found on the right hand side of the default screen layout
(see *Part of the Properties window*\ ).

Panels are also found on the :guilabel:`Tool shelf` and the :guilabel:`Properties shelf` which
are toggleable parts of a 3D Window. To display the :guilabel:`Tool shelf`\ ,
use :menuselection:`View --> Tool` or press :kbd:`T`\ . To display the :guilabel:`Properties shelf`\ ,
use :menuselection:`View --> Properties` or press :kbd:`N`\ .  See *Shelves in a 3D Window*\ .


The :guilabel:`Properties Window` includes the header which allows you to choose from several :doc:`Contexts. <interface/contexts>` Each :guilabel:`Context` will have a different number and type of Panels. For example, the :guilabel:`Render Context` will have panels that allow you to alter the dimensions and anti-aliasing of the render output, while the :guilabel:`Materials Context` will have panels that allow you to set color, transparency, texture, etc.


Panels in the :guilabel:`Properties Window` can be aligned vertically or horizontally by
:kbd:`rmb` on the :guilabel:`Properties Window` and choosing the desired option from the
menu. Note that the Panels in the :guilabel:`Properties Window` are optimized for vertical
alignment. Horizontal alignment may be cumbersome to work with.

The placement and view of panels can also be altered to your preference. For example,
panels can be:


- moved around the window (or shelf) by :kbd:`lmb` clicking, holding and dragging the widget in the upper right corner (this resembles the frame splitter widget and has three lines in a triangle formation).
- scrolled up and down by using :kbd:`wheel`
- zoomed in and out by holding :kbd:`ctrl-mmb` and moving the mouse right and left.
- collapsed/expanded by :kbd:`lmb` clicking the solid black triangle on the left side of their header.


For further details about each panel, see the :doc:`Panels <ce/panels>` reference section, or find the appropriate section in the manual.
