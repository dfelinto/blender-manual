This section is organized by type of nodes, which are grouped based on similar functions:


- :doc:`Input <composite_nodes/types/input>` - Adds something to the node map, such as an image or a value.
- :doc:`Output <composite_nodes/types/output>` - Displays the result in progress as a small image.
- :doc:`Color <composite_nodes/types/color>` - Manipulates the colors of an image.
- :doc:`Vector <composite_nodes/types/vector>` - Manipulate the intensities and reflections of an image
- :doc:`Filters <composite_nodes/types/filter>` - Process the image to enhance it, working on adjacent pixels.
- :doc:`Convertors <composite_nodes/types/convertor>` - Separate the image into its component video, or convert formats.
- :doc:`Mattes <composite_nodes/types/matte>` - Generating mattes to mask off areas of an image.
- :doc:`Distortion <composite_nodes/types/distort>` - Changing the shape of the image.
- :doc:`Groups <composite_nodes/node_groups>` - User-defined groups of nodes.
